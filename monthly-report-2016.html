<p>It's the 5th of February and I feel that I'm much further into the month than I really am. Not sure why that is, perhaps because many things have been carried over from the previous month and I'm also excited about doing all the things that I do.</p>
<p>It's the 8th of February and the start of week two. I feel that the month is now starting to 'run away' and I haven't got to grips with it yet perhaps because there are goals which have carried over from last month. That makes me feel disappointed.</p>
<p>But it's a sense of disappointment that I tend to feel on a regular basis and something that I have reported in the past: that I tend to focus more on what I failed to achieve rather than celebrate what I did achieve. I wrote about it in my Morning Pages today that in spite of doing well in my strength training and cycling I don't feel that I am doing so well with my other goals. While I was out running errands I reflected on as well allowed myself to feel the disappointment and gradually began to see its cause. My results are not in line with my expectations but then I don't really have a clear idea of what those expectations are or a realistic idea of what could be achieved in a given time frame. That clearly is the purpose of this report: to feed back to myself on both my successes and my failings and details thereof to give me an accurate and realistic survey of the intent of each goal, the feeling of the attempt to achieve it and the actual outcome. Instead of expectation on previous performance I only write about my hopes and fears but since I have been writing these reports for a good length time and very consistently that should afford me the capacity to be more clear and precise in my estimations.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>Continue with January workout as it seems to be progressing quite well.</p>
<p>Still very much enjoying this but feel that I need some space around me as many of the exercises are done in the doorway. That doesn't stop them being effective and it hasn't really bothered me in the past but I'm feeling a bit cramped.</p>
<p>During the last session I felt a little under par and rather than miss the session or cut it short what I did was to perform an exercise from the previous level in the progression. I only had to do this for a few of the exercises and found that during the session my strength returned. Today I felt similar when I started out but found that I improved in most of my rep counts and enjoyed myself very much indeed. There was no sense of feeling cramped or any other form of annoyance.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Diet</h4>
<p>See if the 'Chicken Tuesday' idea can be developed into a batch meal with other components. Freeze a meal and then defrost that meal and eat it at some point preferably when you have those times of grazing and feeling lazy about cooking.</p>
<p>When I feel disappointed with my diet my expectation is that I should be able to change to a healthy diet overnight and expunge all forms of undesirable treats entirely. This of course is totally unrealistic and therefore I often swing to the opposite expectation which is that over the course of many weeks, months or even years I will gradually reach a happy balance between the two and that I should not rush this process. I did achieve the 5:2 way of eating more or less overnight so it's clear that I am able to achieve certain dietary goals quite rapidly so what I need to do here is to aim to make my expectations clearer; lay down exactly what I want to eat and what I want to avoid or at least put into a treat category rather like limiting sugar intake for a child.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Yoga practice</h4>
<p>Create a routine and set one session per week as a session where a routine is followed rather than free form and with no distractions.</p>
<p>Still seems to be more of an organic stretching session and I'm still happy that I'm doing something but it's more about maintenance rather than progress. But how much progress do I want? What am I prepared to do in order to achieve that progress? Do I really care about progress?</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing Clutter</h4>
<p>Set aside a time to think about clutter clearing rather than defer the reminder. One pomodoro unit perhaps.</p>
<p>I took my time looking through the database that I've created listing all of the items that I have considered should be discarded. I even took a photo of one such item ready to put onto eBay but have yet to create an auction.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>Set dates to ride two perms: the Ditchling Devil and the Boat Trip. Arrange a day to ride to Much Hadham and ride the potential Artisan Audax.</p>
<p>Rode to Much Hadham and back on Wednesday 3rd of February. It was again with the friend with whom I rode to Meopham at the end of January. It was a dry and cold day with some sunshine but also a bit windy. The headwinds did make the riding hard and it was also tough on the return journey with extra luggage in my pannier: I had essentially commuted to collect spokes for a wheel build. I was very impressed with my friend Junior as it was the furthest that he had ever ridden. Not only did he ride at my pace but he wasn't too tired the following day. Amazing.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming</h4>
<p>Finish the Git course on Codecademy and then follow up with the courses on Code School.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>Type Scout exercises on Thursday and Sunday evenings as a minimum requirement with any more as a bonus.</p>
<p>So far so good in that I have been doing the sessions on Thursday and Sunday evenings.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>Finish Pickwick Papers and make a start on (and hopefully complete) Oliver Twist.</p>
<p>On the 5th of February I'm still continuing with Pickwick Papers and there is a good amount remaining. I'm aware that this means I am making things harder for myself in terms of the next book and the overall goal of completing the entire works. I think that a reading day will be required at some stage. Seems to make sense now.</p>
<p>On the 8th of February I am now at 89% completion of the Pickwick Papers but also feel that I have only 21 days remaining to read Oliver Twist if I am to aim to complete one book per month. I have read the first two chapters from Oliver Twist already but as I know the story and have seen the film adaptation the reading I think would be rather cursory. I do feel somewhat disappointed that I didn't finish the book during January but again this is a conflict of expectation vs reality. The goal was to read 3% per day and then increase that amount to the appropriate figure when I missed a day or read less or more than the required amount. But I also expected to cover that 3% in half an hour and in reality it took me more than hour to read 3% of that book. What I'm not taking into account then is the length of the book i.e. the number of pages. I'm not a quick reader by any means and I also need to be in the correct frame of mind to be able to focus on a novel. Sometimes I find myself falling asleep when I sit down to read or if I am pre-occupied with other things I cannot draw my attention away from those subjects to those of the story. These factors haven't really been addressed or considered.</p>
<p>I have however been keeping track of new words in a Mongo DB database.</p>
<li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
<p>My first duty of the month was an early morning one where I started by responding to SMS 'calls' and then had planned to move over to taking phone calls but then ended up continuing with SMS for the rest of the shift. I want to improve my skills on all types of 'calls': phone, SMS and emails and wonder if I should focus on just one during a shift or do some of each.</p>
<li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
<p>I believe in my idea of the wheel tracking web service but do other wheel builders? I need to ascertain this before I start work on it. This month do some customer research and see how much it is really wanted.</p>
