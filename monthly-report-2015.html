<p>The start of April and I'm not really with it due to finishing the end of last month spending time in bed ill and now gradually recovering. It's also Easter time and the days that I take Maya have changed or rather that I'm not seeing her over the Easter weekend which again makes things appear odd as seeing Maya is such a regular feature in my life. But in that sense it's a break, a time to stop and reflect.</p>
<p>It's the 14th of the month so we are about halfway through and I feel that I am really catching up on all fronts. I have been getting my website work done which I have neglected for a long while, getting back on my bike after being ill at the end of last month and rebuilding my enthusiasm for programming and computing so it's all very exciting.</p>
<p>Had another short bout of illness earlier this week on the 15th. This time due to some sort of stomach upset which resulted in me feeling weak and completely exhausted. It was possibly due to some mouldy strawberries that I had eaten on the previous evening along with some very ripe Camembert. Usually my stomach is very strong with this sort of thing but I guess I my immune system may have been a little depleted following my ride at the weekend which as well as being the furthest that I have ever ridden on a ride was also a night ride. I spent the day sitting out in the garden in my new deck chair reading and enjoying some hot sunshine. Not bad for a day being ill but didn't make much of a dent on the to do list.</p>
<p>April seems to be a bit of rest and recovery month. In spite of one big ride and another one forthcoming tomorrow there hasn't been any training. One long weekend taken up with the Easter break, one with a visit from relatives and a few easy days due to illness. Things haven't ground to a halt and there has been plenty of thinking and planning going on but I am not pushing ahead as I had been during the first quarter.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>The first week has been a recovery week with zero on the first day, then a cut down session on the 2nd and then sub-maximal on the third i.e. not able to reach the rep counts that I have been reaching recently. Shows how hard the illness hit me.</p>
<p>Another Wednesday missed due to illness but slowly regaining pace and I'm almost at the rep counts that were possible prior to my short bout of illness at the end of March. It just shows how quickly strength is lost and how hard it is to regain. Today I used music to help motivate me as is the case in most gyms but it did not affect any great boost to my performance.</p>
<p>One of the things that I've tried this month is to ride on the training rollers prior to my workout. Even though this does warm me up it seems to have a demotivating effect. Today having missed my session due to riding on Wednesday I was already keen to get a session done but not sufficiently motivated to be focused. I watched a couple of short YouTube videos on pull-up workouts which reminded me of the importance of proper form and that it is better to do fewer reps with better form as opposed to purely quantity for its own sake. The other thing that I gleaned during my 10 minutes of video motivation was the importance of the negative phase of the movement. While I watched the videos I performed some basic limbering movements to warm up. Going forward I think that I will make this a regular part of the session and am considering a fourth set in addition to the three that I already do at the moment. Not quite sure what I would do in that set but it's not urgent. It's more important that I maintain my routine rather than try to do more and then find that I start to skip it. The other thing that I've noticed is that of the three types of pull-ups that I perform during my session I do the hardest one last so a change of order is perhaps required. One thing that has been on my list for a while is to have one or two sessions a month where I push things a little harder than usual. A friend who also does a regular home workout similar to mine recommended this to me but I have yet to try it. In addition to Reading Day, there is also now a Programming Day so I could also introduce a workout day but it wouldn't be a full day but just a slightly longer session.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p>This month I have been keeping track of the amount of vegetables and fruit that I'm consuming each day using the 5-a-day system as my guide. Today is the 9th of April and so far I can see that my average is around two. Which means a distinct lack of food items that count towards my 5-a-day intake. Yesterday I had a celebratory meal, my first 1500 mile meal which was taken at the Wagamama restaurant. The meal did contain a good amount of vegetables but immediately afterwards I consumed sugary desserts and a cut price chocolate egg. Very soon after that I shared a bag of chips with Maya. It was a highly enjoyable non-fasting day but it seems that I haven't exhausted my love of junk food and it may take more than a food log to introduce more fruit and veg into my diet.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>During the few days of my illness I practiced yoga in bed which I thought was commendable given my general lack of energy. This shows that I am indeed motivated.</p>
<p>Very much a maintenance program and also seem to be missing around 1-2 sessions a week. It has gradually become polluted again with watching something while I practice. I think I should focus more on audio rather than video by listening to the radio or a podcast. I had a long stint of listening to This American Life while doing yoga but Mark Kermode's film reviews are also good as well as Radio 4 shows such as In Our Time.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p>Two old rims sawed up and binned today. They had been sitting around and watching me for a long time. I had laced them to check if they could be re-used but both were beyond that point.</p>
<p>Had a plan to look through my clothes last week but it didn't happen. This week I threw out a load of back issues of Arrivee magazine which felt good as I never go back to read them and they are all available online anyway. The deep fat fryer is still bugging me but I have checked on ebay and the most I could get for it is only about &pound;7.00 which is lower than what I usually consider as worth selling.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>So far, today being the 9th I haven't been riding at all. This is slightly worrying as I have a big ride tomorrow, in fact the biggest I have ever done, a 300km ride but having been recuperating from my illness and then taking it easy following a full body deep tissue massage on the 5th I think that I may not have lost too much fitness since my last ride as I have still been commuting. The amount of riding has been low but hasn't been zero.</p>
<p>Starting at one mintue past midnight on the 11th of the month I did my first audax ride of the month. I plan to do more. It was my first night ride and also my first 300km ride. I rode it fixed gear mainly to be able to use my pannier in order to carry plenty of food. In the end I found that I didn't need it but it was still nice to have my more familiar bike and to use the newer ratio that I've been using for my commuting. I want to write a separate longer post about this ride so I'll keep it brief and cover only the highlights. I finished in a very good time of 15h 8mins which is incredible for me as I normally complete a 200km ride in just under 12 hours. Really enjoyed riding through the night and am now keen to have a go at the Dunwich Dynamo and probably others too. Not too tired or achy after the ride at least not half as much as I had expected and my RRtY requirement for this month is done. I have also accrued another 3 months for my FWC or Fixed Wheel Challenge so I need to check that to see how close I am to getting the 25 points.</p>
<p>On the 22nd I rode the Boulters Bash audax ride for 2nd or possibly the 3rd time. This time though instead of getting the train to Maidenhead Brad and I rode to the start. We set off from the Imperial War Museum at 07:00. The first part of the route took us along the towpath along the Grand Union Canal near Paddington all the way to Southall. We found the road surface to be a bit too bumpy for us so even though the sun reflecting from the water and lack of motor vehicle traffic made it pleasant we opted for main roads in order to speed things up and arrive in good time. We took our time when we arrived and had a second breakfast then started the actual ride about 20 minutes late feeling very cocky seeing others arrive in their cars. We had quite a fast first half and the weather was perfect: neither too warm nor too cold with just a slight breeze. The fields were full of green and yellow rape and the trees were just starting to sprout their buds. There was a distinct lack of traffic in the country lanes and the road surfaces very fairly smooth most of the way. Having ridden a 300 with no information controls it seems a bit futile to be stopping every 20km or so taking note of what was written on road signs. The halfway control was Little Henry's Cafe in Pangbourne. This was a proper manned control where we got our card stamped. Neither of us wanted to have a proper sit down meal so we opted for the co-op supermarket across the road but still ended up stopping for more than half an hour. I was slightly disappointed about this but as we weren't aiming for a speedy finish I soon put my disappointment to one side. The second half was a lot more difficult. The road surfaces were a lot worse and there were a good deal of climbs some of which caused us to struggle a great deal. I kept forgetting to change down to a suitable gear being used to riding fixed. Nevertheless by pushing down with all my might I managed to get to the top without having to get off. On the final big climb which Brad called the quarry road I switched to the inner ring and took it easy as it was both long and steep. During the last 10km or so I found that my Garmin gps started to struggle with screen redraws and refreshes. This was rather worrying as it has never happened before and the device has always been very reliable. After a sit down and a chat with a rider that I had seen on the 300 a couple of weeks ago we thought about our return ride. I suggested a main road route that I had plotted the evening before but found that my Garmin was frozen and wouldn't load the map. I tried turning it off and on again but to no avail. Thankfully Brad's device was fully working and he plotted a route on the fly. The route took us along the A4 or the old Bath Road. It wasn't too pleasant at that time of day but the weather was still agreeable and the road surface was a great improvement over the 2nd half of the audax ride. I did experience a slight dip in energy till we reached the outskirts of London when I perked up again. We shook hands and said goodbye at the Horniman Museum where Brad works and a few minutes later was home. I was surprisingly fresh with little or no aches and pains. A very pleasant surprise with only some tightness at the top of my right glute.</p>
<p>Following the above ride in Maidenhead I did very little aside from commuting and then over the next weekend had three days in a row off the bike. On the Monday that followed however I rode to Much Hadham, to Artisan Cycles and also rode it non-stop which took me a little over 3 hours. It was a fairly pleasant day albeit cold and there was a slight headwind from Epping onwards. I always tend to worry that my fitness is going down but this showed that it would take a lot longer before I lose it. I stripped my fixed gear bike (the one that I rode there) of all its components ready for the frame to be shipped to Italy to be upgraded: new carbon forks, bottle bosses to mount cages and a proper rear brake bridge to mount a rear brake for those scary descents and also to be able to fit a rear mudguard effectively. I'm sad to be without it but have re-assembled my "Sweden bike" which was actually my very first fixed gear bike for general commuting while my made to measure fixie is away on holiday.</p>

<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p>Been looking at the courses on the Pragmatic Studio website. They look very similar to the Code School courses in that they have instructional video lectures followed by accompanying exercises. However, they are a lot more expensive compared to Code School. Not entirely outside of my price range, however I wouldn't want to pay the price and then find I lose motivation or time. The focus is mainly on Ruby and Rails. In some ways I'm excited about Ruby since doing the Programming Languages course and understanding it's functional side but it also feels like a throwback to 2009 when I first got on this home study of programming trying to learn Ruby and Rails. Perhaps six years on it will come more easily and also be more rewarding especially as the technology has matured a lot and my general programming knowledge and skills have improved a great deal too.</p>
<p>As well as watching the videos from the Pragmatic Studio series I have also been reading from the book Functional Javascript both of which is inspiring me to do more study. I keep telling myself that the reason that I haven't been doing it is because I've been riding or that I have a lot of work to do but I still have time on my hands and if I am genuinely enthused about something then I'll find a way to fit it in.</p>
<p>I am getting very excited about doing more programming and in the process of formulating a plan for the rest of the year. I have quite a long list of courses and books that I would like to pursue but it is not one that could be easily covered in the 8 months or so that remain this year. This smacks of my original plan from 2009 where the focus was very much on developing skills in order to further my career. But this time the focus is less intense. I am more focused on the learning itself rather than the potential career prospects which means less time pressure. If I follow this plan in the same way as I am following my cycling plan then perhaps by the end of 2016 I will have completed my long list of languages and technologies that I would like to study. If that leads to work then that would be very welcome but mainly it is for my own understanding and learning. If I am more confident and capable by the end of it then all to the good. I can already see a big improvement since 2009 in spite of my efforts being somewhat inconsistent.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>Patchy at best. I would say that the rate is about three times a week and I'm still continuing to follow my plan consisting of the two exercises that I have described previously. Performance is improving but it is hard to tell how much is maintenance and how much is progress. As I keep pushing for higher speeds I make more errors. Should I just stop pushing and settle for a speed where my accuracy is greater? But then I want to improve both speed and accuracy.</p>
<p>During the final week of April my typing practice was totally neglected. I seem to be maintaining my current level which is around the 60 wpm mark with an accuracy of 95% so I'm fairly happy with that but I would like to take it beyond this level so that when I do experience lapses in training and I drop my performance level a little I would still enjoy a level that was more than adequate.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I've started reading The Time Machine by H G Wells and since it is a short work I think that I should be able to complete it well inside the month time frame and also complete my other choice of Three Men in a Boat. I think I have already mentioned these books in my previous report but I'm excited at the thought of actually catching up to my one book a month goal. Of the ones that have been lacking this is really picking up again and I hope to do some audio book recording his month too.</p>
<p>I've now (9th) finished the Time Machine and am well on my way into the Three Men in a Boat book. It's laugh out loud funny and makes a change from the others that I've been reading. It was recommended as a classic by Amazon readers which is why I chose it and I'm glad that I did. It reminds me of a previous strategy that I had for reading which was to alternate between high and low brow literature.</p>
<p>Now that the weather is getting warmer and the sun is finally coming out I have bought myself a deck chair so that I can sit and read comfortably in the garden.</p>
<p>Reading day today 20th of April. A beautiful sunny day although a little windy. I've finished Three Men in a Boat then looked through many on the Kindle store and the Guardian's Top 100 books to settle on Don Quixote. But having downloaded it I picked up on a book that I started last year, Thoreau's Walden.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
<p>Following the shocking statistics shown in a BBC Panorama programme called, "Suicide in the Family", I have decided to put myself forward to try and help those who might be added to the number of the biggest killer of adult males below 50 in the UK. I have made an application to the Samaritans and am looking forward to an introductory day with them to learn more about the process of becoming a volunteer listener and the time commitment that it will involve.</p>
