<p>It's April and the sun has finally come out. It has been nice to finally get out in the garden again after what feels like a very long winter. After a good amount of leisure last month I feel that I want to pursue my goals more fully again this month but obviously without any pressure.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>The main for this month is consistency and consolidation. I don't really want to move forward as such on to the next exercise. At the moment I am nearing the 3 sets of 8 reps for each of the exercises that I'm doing but the form is not super strict and could do with some improvement which is really what I want to work on this month. Just get each rep smooth and get a sense that I feel very comfortable and could almost do it easily.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Diet</h4>
<p>Last month I experimented with eating more protein and I think it helped with my strength training but it also helped me to create a structure around which to hang my meals and it proved to be generally healthier: I cooked, I planned ahead, I ate a lot more veg and I ate a lot less junk food. So the plan this month is to simply continue with that and see how it goes. I can't really think of how I would improve this regime and it has been the most effective one both in terms of motivation and ease of application.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Yoga practice</h4>
<p>Even though doing an intuitive and organic session gets me on the mat I still think a little bit of structure would help. I have put some ideas on the table about having a structured session once a week or using a timer but it's rare that I do it. I also haven't been working on the hand stand much which was meant to be my goal for the year: that is something I need to bring back into the sessions just to see if I am still into the idea and perhaps use a timer in one session.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing Clutter</h4>
<p>Not sure what to assign myself this month as I didn't really get very far last month.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>This month I have 2 Audax rides planned and one booked so I need to get out and train but having had 2 months off I am not very motivated. Again I don't really want to push myself as it's meant to be fun rather than fulfilling quotas. The first one is a very hilly 200km ride so if I enjoy that one then it will show that I'm still into it.</p>
<p>Managed to get out for a ride today, the 6th, in preparation for the hilly ride on Saturday the 9th. It was a 100km ride into Kent / Surrey mainly to test my fitness both physical and mental. Having not ridden any long rides for around 2 months I am concerned about how well my body performs on the bike and also having quit a ride that I had booked last month I wondered also if I had gone off the idea altogether. I can safely say that my physical fitness hasn't gone down too much as there were 2-3 long challenging climbs and along with that it was very wet and windy. I got thoroughly soaked and then dried off and then got soaked again in a heavy downpour. I didn't really stop other than for a short 10 minute halfway break and ate only a handful of dates. I can feel sure about my fitness level then and rest assured that I'll be ok in that department. But what about enjoyment? I would say that I enjoyed it more than I had expected but not as much as I had hoped. What does that mean? Well, if you had asked me at any point during the ride if I was enjoying it then I had expected that around 40% of the time I would have replied in the affirmative but as it turned out the actual enjoyment level was more like 60% but I had hoped for something like 80%. At times I did experience some boredom and some flashbacks of riding perms when I didn't want to but on the whole it was great to get out and ride and it reminded me of how much I had missed it. I'm now looking forward to Saturday and hopefully the weather will be better than it was today.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming</h4>
<p>Having more or less neglected this last month my strategy this month is to assign 3 sessions each week a bit like with the strength training to see if that will work. One session of Code Eval; one of Code School and one following one of the Functional Programming books. The question is when to assign those sessions. I think I will need to do it at the start of each week and see how it goes and if I do actually feel like doing it at the appointed time.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>More or less carry on with last month really: work on accuracy over speed.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I didn't manage to complete Nicholas Nickleby last month therefore the first thing is to finish that one and then obviously to start the next one in the series and hopefully complete it too.</p>
<li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
<p>As well as doing my normal listening duties I have been considering if I should like to get involved with some other activity such as mentoring, fundraising or caller support. It's not a requirement but at first the commitment of six shifts over an eight week period seemed to be a lot greater than it actually is and I feel as though I am not really contributing very much. I suppose I could take on more shifts but at the same time I don't want to burn myself out either. I'm probably too inexperienced to mentor a new trainee but it will go into the someday / maybe list. But I'll look into one of the other admin or management roles and see if anything takes my fancy.</p>
<li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
<p>Since the beginning of the year I have been thinking about my wheel building database idea for other wheel builders as a subscription service and the first step was to get proof of concept by asking potential clients to give me their views: still feeling shy about it I guess. I'm going to set it as a goal for this month again but as it has been 3 months since the start of the year when I initially set it I don't set my hopes too high.</p>
<p>The other one-off goal for the year was to find some sort of part-time job. When I usually think about this I assume that it will be technology related but it doesn't necessarily have to be. It has to be only half a day a week, working from home and with no annoying clients. When I mentioned this to a friend he suggested that I write articles and blog posts as he has read my blog posts and says that I can write. My goal then this month is to consider other similar idea and see if it might be possible to pursue them.</p>
