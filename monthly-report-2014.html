<p>So here we are at the end of the year. It's the 29th of December in that 'corridor' between Christmas and new year. I have been thinking a little about the year that has passed and how I have fared with my list of goals. Also on the importance of having a list of goals and how that has helped me to achieve them. Having looked through one or two reports during the year I have actually done rather well given that I only started to put effort into it after the six month mark.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Working out</h4>
<p></p></li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p></p></li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p></p></li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p></p></li>
<li><h4>Audax</h4>
<p></p></li>
<li><h4>Bike training</h4>
<p>Not much to say really except that this idea stayed on the page. It is indeed a good idea if it had been implemented then it would have improved my speed and strength but I guess having only seen the figures or the articles on paper and not actually proved them to myself, some part of me wasn't convinced enough to follow through. Or simply that greater speed and strength on the bike wasn't valuable enough for me to engage with this kind of training. It's the sort of training a racer or time trailist would undertake so it seems perhaps a little excessive for a hobbyist / audaxer. But then audax routes do contain hilly sections and there is a time limit. But even at my slowest I've never been out of time so the only training required is long rides.</p></li>
<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p></p></li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p></p></li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p></p></li>
<li><h4>Staying in touch with friends</h4>
<p></p></li>
</ul>
