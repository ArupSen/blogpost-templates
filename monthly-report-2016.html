<p>We kick off March on the first of the month and after two weeks or so of feeling under the weather I feel back on track and raring to go. Some of the goals from last month are being carried forward because I didn't get a chance to work on them or simply put them off.</p>
<p>Starting from this month one major change has occurred which is that I have a new lodger. I wasn't too happy with my previous lodger. He made a lot of noise and didn't really clean up after himself. I got tired of having to tell him about it and found that a friend needed a place to live and wasn't too happy in his place of abode. I hope now that the home environment will be a lot more supportive and conducive to harmonious living and the one unpleasant feature in my life has been eliminated.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>Essentially carry over what I've been doing in February. In some of the exercises I am close to being able to perform 3 x 8 repetitions which means I would be then ready to progress to the next level of difficulty. I do want to be able to perform those reps with very good style before moving on rather than try to jump ahead in a slap dash manner.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Diet</h4>
<p>The goal for this month already started in February which was to base my diet around a protein target of 60g per day: 20g per meal. It's an experimental idea in that it will be a six week trial period.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Yoga practice</h4>
<p>What I need to do is to get back to my handstand practice and even though I'm working on postures every session I need to come up with a routine that I can follow every now and then where I am actively working on certain postures. In the strength training I am working with exercises with progressive levels of difficulty and perhaps I could do the same with yoga. For example I could have one for forward bends, backbends, sidebends and twists, then find the appropriate level for my current ability.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing Clutter</h4>
<p>I had the idea of putting together the items that I would consider discarding for each room or section of the flat. At least then they would be on display and perhaps remind me that they need to go.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>Having had a 2 week break from riding in general let alone long rides I have to rebuild my fitness and work towards my next Audax ride on the 13th of March. I'm not sure if I want to still work at the double RRtY but let's say I ride the calendar Audax on the 13th and then a perm and I'll see how I feel about it after that.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming</h4>
<p>I didn't get anywhere with my goals last month but I did make a start on the Code School course ES 2015, so what I'll do is to work toward finishing that one and leave it open as to what else I do.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>I thought about trying another tutor and perhaps starting again from scratch but I'm not sure if that would help. I think I will just continue with what I've been doing but simply focus more on accuracy rather than speed this month and stay aware of the types of mistakes that I'm making.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I'm almost done with Oliver Twist as I'm now at 93% so once that is complete I will move on to the next book Nicholas Nickleby.</p>
<li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
<p>One shift so far and that was on the 1st of March. I got a bit wet riding there but the shift itself went very smoothly and I ate a good amount of biscuits: probably the only time in the week that I consume biscuits. Good to work with a volunteer that I haven't worked with before.</p>
<li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
<p>Last month my goal was to send emails to wheel builders to gather information about my idea and see how many people would use it and whether it would be worth creating. Speaking to a friend I said that I'm being a bit lazy about it and that the sooner I can get hold of this information the sooner I can move: make a start or quit.</p>
