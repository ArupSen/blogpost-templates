<p>So here we are at the end of the year. It's the 29th of December in that 'corridor' between Christmas and new year. I have been thinking a little about the year that has passed and how I have fared with my list of goals. Also on the importance of having a list of goals and how that has helped me to achieve them. Having looked through one or two reports during the year I have actually done rather well given that I only started to put effort into it after the six month mark.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Working out</h4>
<p>This month I've been taking it a little easier as I've been recovering from the back injury I had last month but I'm more or less back to my normal level. I can't believe how consistent I've been with it. I guess partly because the session is so short in that lasts only 15 minutes. I have been doing the session religiously three times a week and have been seeing gains i.e. increases in reps every 2-3 weeks. Earlier this year if you had told me that I would be able to do 10 pull ups I would have thought you were mad as they were all assisted ones when I began. But now doing 10 pull ups through a full range of motion using good form is simply part of my routine and I can even realistically consider the idea of setting the goal at 20. As with other goals that are going well I often think about increasing the number of sets or the number of exercises but then worry about breaking the routine altogether: don't want to ruin a good thing. Think I'm happy with that I've got at the moment.</p></li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p></p></li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p></p></li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p></p></li>
<li><h4>Audax</h4>
<p></p></li>
<li><h4>Bike training</h4>
<p>Not much to say really except that this idea stayed on the page. It is indeed a good idea if it had been implemented then it would have improved my speed and strength but I guess having only seen the figures or the articles on paper and not actually proved them to myself, some part of me wasn't convinced enough to follow through. Or simply that greater speed and strength on the bike wasn't valuable enough for me to engage with this kind of training. It's the sort of training a racer or time trialist would undertake so it seems perhaps a little excessive for a hobbyist / audaxer. But then audax routes do contain hilly sections and there is a time limit. But even at my slowest I've never been out of time so the only training required is long rides.</p></li>
<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p></p></li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>Having discovered a software that would keep me at it I have indeed done so. The software in question is called Type Scout which I have probably mentioned in previous reports. I kept to my original plan of doing something like 15 minutes a day but this past month as I have been partial to using the Pomodoro technique I extended the session to the standard 25 minute period. I have certainly improved my typing skills but perhaps not as much as I would have thought but practice includes both maintenance as well as progress. I have enjoyed it very much and certainly feel that the exercises and general discipline have been worthwhile. I would still like to improve further both in terms of accuracy and speed and now have a sense of how much time and effort that will require. My current speed and accuracy is quite sufficient for my needs but one always wants more.</p></li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>Just from glancing through some of the books in my 'Read in 2014' collection I can see more than I had expected. I have actually read six books this year which is half of my annual target. I'm quite surprised. Three Thomas Hardy novels and two by W. Somerset Maugham and the George Orwell classic, 1984.</p></li>
<li><h4>Staying in touch with friends</h4>
<p>Although the idea with this goal was to be quite systematic the end result was in fact quite organic which sort of defeats the points of having it set as a goal. The idea behind the goal was to contact a friend on the list each month by some means so that the contact is not missed but that didn't happen in any month. I do recall making a list at some point and then next to their name I put a date for when they were last contacted and how. Without checking I would assume that happened last year and the goal was simply carried over. This year due to the lack of response from some friends following any contact made by me I somehow feel that my efforts have been in vain. I don't think I want to drop the idea of systematic contact entirely but think I will drop it as a goal on the list of goals for next year. Perhaps just a regular monthly reminder in my phone.</p></li>
