<p>Tired today. Really tired. When I mounted the bike my legs felt heavy and wondered whether I should even be on there. I have a big ride on Sunday (starting at 02:00) so shouldn't I be resting so that I am fully recovered? But as always when I start off feeling a bit reluctant, after a few minutes I got a little more motivated and my legs felt a little less heavy. At first I thought I wouldn't do any high speed spins but as soon as I was warmed up and feeling more motivated I did a sprint. I didn't go as fast or as long as I did yesterday but it was fun. I did three of these at random times and continued until I could see the countdown timer flashing that it had finished. In the background there was Disney's Aladdin playing at a very high volume in order to be heard over the sound of the rollers.</p>
