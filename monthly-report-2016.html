<p>The start of September feels like the end of the summer holidays and getting back to work. I have only just completed the August report having not set any goals and neglected any ongoing reporting. This month I'm keen to get going with my goals and have a clear idea of what I want to achieve this month. I also want to keep a closer eye on what I'm doing and how well I'm progressing through the month. This months report could therefore end up becoming fairly long.</p>
<p>Only three days later I feel that I have a lot to say but not really: I just feel that I am keeping track of it all and that I'm staying excited about it. I have printed off my list of goals for the month, which is something that I haven't done before and it keeps reminding me of what I am planning to accomplish this month. I'll keep adding short reports.</p>
<p>On the 8th and 9th I had a little downtime due to feeling totally exhausted. On the 8th I had to go out and teach after having woken up with severe cramp in my left calf. It made it hard to ride and quite difficult to teach classes but somehow I managed. On the Friday, the 9th, I was so exhausted I had to just rest and that was a big change to what I had planned.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>Continue with the Reddit recommended routine. Focus on better form and dipping into the next level.</p>
<p>On Monday 5th I did another session following the Friday 2nd where I was again fasting and didn't use my yoghurt and banana pre-workout snack but felt equal to the task nevertheless. Don't know what is happening with the dips as they keep going up and down.</p>
<p>Another great session on the 7th where I didn't feel too keen at the start. But it was a hot day which made things easier and the final sets of exercises seemed to be very comfortable so probably need to be upgraded.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Diet</h4>
<p>Try the August approach again: Keeping track with myfitnesspal, follow a meal plan, no snacks but a touch more lenient.</p>
<p>Over the 3rd and 4th which was a weekend when I had Maya staying with me I did go slightly over my allowance but not much and I did eat a bit more junk food but it wasn't excessive in the way it may have been in the past. She also wasn't too bothered about not having too much chocolate or snacks.</p>
<p>On Thursday 8th I had a gap between classes and resorted to consuming junk food and then on Friday 9th, my usual fasting day I skipped it because I was so exhausted that day and enjoyed some comfort food comprising of samosas, jalebi and crumpets. I don't regret it but on Saturday 10th I am resuming with my typical fast.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Yoga practice</h4>
<p>Sessions without any screen time so only audio if required such as music, podcasts, audio books or radio. Use a timer for poses, focus on breathing, do an advanced version of Rich's program as he is away during September. Handstands on non-workout days.</p>
<p>From the 2nd to the 5th I've done yoga without any distraction, holding postures for a given time (one minute so far) and employing deep breathing. It's been great and I felt more focused and engaged as though I was on a solitary retreat.</p>
<p>I missed yoga on the 7th due to Samaritans in the evening and hadn't structured my day in order to cater for that. I also missed it on Friday 9th when I essentially dropped everything.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing Clutter</h4>
<p>Sell my extra bike parts and throw out any worn out bits in the wheel room.</p>
<p>2nd September threw out packaging and worn items such as a sawn up rim and spoke pieces.</p>
<p>I've taken some photos of a set of handlebars and saved them as a draft on eBay.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>Complete 2 x 200 plus rides. The Flatlands 600 is already booked for the 10th. Rollers at least once a week.</p>
<p>2nd September had a 20 minute roller session with no specific aims other than to ride.</p>
<p>Had another 15 minute roller session on the 3rd while Maya was here. Great warm up to yoga and also proved to myself that I can do it while Maya is here.</p>
<p>Due to the cramping calves and exhaustion on Thursday 8th I cancelled my plans to travel to Much Hadham on Friday 9th where I was due to stay over prior to my ride on Saturday 10th, the Flatlands 600. As well as feeling physically unwell there was rain forecast for Saturday so I have no regrets. It's a shame to miss the opportunity to complete my fixed wheel super randonneur but I can always try next year. I would still like to continue with my double parallel RRtY challenge which means that I will need to ride 2 x 200km rides this month. If I am to get the 40@40 badge then I'll need to ride at least one.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming</h4>
<p>Code school mobile design courses to help me build a responsive Racer Rosa website and also my wheelbuilding site.</p>
<p>2nd September started on the HTML / CSS path in Code School. Should be able to cruise through it fairly quickly as the material is totally familiar but should hopefully pick up some new ideas.</p>
<p>Over the weekend of the 3/4th I have completed the Front End Foundations course and most of the Front End Formations course on Code School. The first one was very basic and in a way wasn't necessary but the second one gave some good updates on HTML5 and CSS3. I can make my code a lot more semantic using the new tags that I haven't been using and I can use CSS3 to do the job of JS where those rules are supported.</p>
<p>Over the 6th and 7th I completed CSS Cross Country and managed to glean a few tips and techniques. After that I went on to watch a couple of "Watch Us Build" video follow ups which showed how to use material from those three courses. Again most of it wasn't new to me but there were ideas and practices that I would be able to use in my own work. I have some good ideas on how to refactor and update my Static Site Starter framework to HTML5.</p>
<p>I'm more or less done with the Journey into Mobile course which goes into making websites Adaptive and Responsive. That will make it four courses. What I haven't been doing is taking notes which is something that I will do once I've finished the one that I'm on. I haven't been taking notes because I feel that this is all review but there are things here that are new to me.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>Add a third session on top of my current two (or more) per week for 'burst' sessions where the focus is entirely on speed.</p>
<p>I've been doing my regular sessions but still haven't had a burst session and it's now the 10th.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>Read 2 books this month and then possibly continue till the end of the year if it works this month. I spend a lot of time on TV, movies and gaming: could I move that time to reading?</p>
<p>On the 1st I completed Barnaby Rudge and purchased Martin Chuzzlewit. It has 54 chapters which I need to cover in 2 weeks or 14 days which is roughly 4 chapters a day: a great deal more than I'm used to reading!</p>
<p>I managed to read a lot over the weekend, certainly more than I would normally especially when I have Maya here but it still wasn't enough to cover 4 chapters in a day. I worked out that it takes me almost an hour to read a chapter from this book and therefore to read for four hours to complete my task is far more than I can commit each day. I found myself struggling with head nodding and also getting distracted. The craving for screen time was strong especially having done so much of it so freely over the course of August but I did manage to limit it. This challenge is definitely a bit unrealistic but I'll go on with it just to see how far I get and how I respond to it.</p>
<p>I managed to read for a good 2 hours on the 6th but even though I had time later on I used it to watch TV series instead. I do enjoy screen time and it will take some time to wean myself off it.</p>
<p>On the 7th, 8th and 9th I didn't read my book at all which I am a bit miffed about but that's how it has been. Today is the 10th and I read one chapter and have now completed 10 out of 54. The fact that I'm not going to ride this weekend means that I could catch up a bit. Let's see.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
<p>Get my mentee ready for their solo shift, commitment & SIT2 training. Come up with a fund-raising strategy for the branch in readiness for the financial status of the branch changing on the 1st of October.</p>
<p>As they haven't been able to take calls themselves yet due to the delay in receiving their DBS we did a lengthy skills practice where I pretended to be a caller.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 7th my mentee took her first call. She did really well and I feel very proud. It's a big step going from the classroom to actually taking a real call. She said that she felt very comfortable about it which gave me confidence that I hadn't pushed her into it too early but then I couldn't have done that as the DBS hadn't been approved anyway. Even though I've been enjoying being a mentor it was nice to also to do a duty on my own.</p>
<p>I've got a couple of meetings set up with professional fundraisers later in the month which should give me some good ideas to create a fundraising strategy.</p>
<li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
<p>Build a Hackintosh laptop for my housemate.</p>
<p>He has intimated that if a desktop would be an easier job for me then he would be happy with that. I know of one that I could use and at a very good price.</p>
<p>I seem to have found a 19in monitor too which means only graphics card, memory and SSD to acquire.</p>
