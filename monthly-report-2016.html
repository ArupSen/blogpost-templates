<p>The start of September feels like the end of the summer holidays and getting back to work. I have only just completed the August report having not set any goals and neglected any ongoing reporting. This month I'm keen to get going with my goals and have a clear idea of what I want to achieve this month. I also want to keep a closer eye on what I'm doing and how well I'm progressing through the month. This months report could therefore end up becoming fairly long.</p>
<p>Only three days later I feel that I have a lot to say but not really: I just feel that I am keeping track of it all and that I'm staying excited about it. I have printed off my list of goals for the month, which is something that I haven't done before and it keeps reminding me of what I am planning to accomplish this month. I'll keep adding short reports.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>Continue with the Reddit recommended routine. Focus on better form and dipping into the next level.</p>
<p>On Monday 5th I did another session following the Friday 2nd where I was again fasting and didn't use my yoghurt and banana pre-workout snack but felt equal to the task nevertheless. Don't know what is happening with the dips as they keep going up and down.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Diet</h4>
<p>Try the August approach again: Keeping track with myfitnesspal, follow a meal plan, no snacks but a touch more lenient.</p>
<p>Over the 3rd and 4th which was a weekend when I had Maya staying with me I did go slightly over my allowance but not much and I did eat a bit more junk food but it wasn't excessive in the way it may have been in the past. She also wasn't too bothered about not having too much chocolate or snacks.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Yoga practice</h4>
<p>Sessions without any screen time so only audio if required such as music, podcasts, audio books or radio. Use a timer for poses, focus on breathing, do an advanced version of Rich's program as he is away during September. Handstands on non-workout days.</p>
<p>From the 2nd to the 5th I've done yoga without any distraction, holding postures for a given time (one minute so far) and employing deep breathing. It's been great and I felt more focused and engaged as though I was on a solitary retreat.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing Clutter</h4>
<p>Sell my extra bike parts and throw out any worn out bits in the wheel room.</p>
<p>2nd September threw out packaging and worn items such as a sawn up rim and spoke pieces.</p>
<p>I've taken some photos of a set of handlebars and saved them as a draft on eBay.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>Complete 2 x 200 plus rides. The Flatlands 600 is already booked for the 10th. Rollers at least once a week.</p>
<p>2nd September had a 20 minute roller session with no specific aims other than to ride.</p>
<p>Had another 15 minute roller session on the 3rd while Maya was here. Great warm up to yoga and also proved to myself that I can do it while Maya is here.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming</h4>
<p>Code school mobile design courses to help me build a responsive Racer Rosa website and also my wheelbuilding site.</p>
<p>2nd September started on the HTML / CSS path in Code School. Should be able to cruise through it fairly quickly as the material is totally familiar but should hopefully pick up some new ideas.</p>
<p>Over the weekend of the 3/4th I have completed the Front End Foundations course and most of the Front End Formations course on Code School. The first one was very basic and in a way wasn't necessary but the second one gave some good updates on HTML5 and CSS3. I can make my code a lot more semantic using the new tags that I haven't been using and I can use CSS3 to do the job of JS where those rules are supported.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>Add a third session on top of my current two (or more) per week for 'burst' sessions where the focus is entirely on speed.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>Read 2 books this month and then possibly continue till the end of the year if it works this month. I spend a lot of time on TV, movies and gaming: could I move that time to reading?</p>
<p>On the 1st I completed Barnaby Rudge and purchased Martin Chuzzlewit. It has 54 chapters which I need to cover in 2 weeks or 14 days which is roughly 4 chapters a day: a great deal more than I'm used to reading!</p>
<p>I managed to read a lot over the weekend, certainly more than I would normally especially when I have Maya here but it still wasn't enough to cover 4 chapters in a day. I worked out that it takes me almost an hour to read a chapter from this book and therefore to read for four hours to complete my task is far more than I can commit each day. I found myself struggling with head nodding and also getting distracted. The craving for screen time was strong especially having done so much of it so freely over the course of August but I did manage to limit it. This challenge is definitely a bit unrealistic but I'll go on with it just to see how far I get and how I respond to it.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
<p>Get my mentee ready for their solo shift, commitment & SIT2 training. Come up with a fund-raising strategy for the branch in readiness for the financial status of the branch changing on the 1st of October.</p>
<p>As they haven't been able to take calls themselves yet due to the delay in receiving their DBS we did a lengthy skills practice where I pretended to be a caller.</p>
<li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
<p>Build a Hackintosh laptop for my housemate.</p>
<p>He has intimated that if a desktop would be an easier job for me then he would be happy with that. I know of one that I could use and at a very good price.</p>
</li>
</ul>
