<p>As 2015 drew to a close I was doing so well with my goals that essentially all that I wanted to do was carry everything over to 2016. Other than some small adjustments the same headings will again be used. For the October 2015 monthly report I started to set goals for the month as well as ongoing reporting. These goals were clear and specific and something that could realistically be achieved in a month. But doing this made me think about it as an idea for the whole year. Prior to this, the ongoing goals have been only about getting a routine established as some of the practices were patchy at best. Now that the routines are indeed well established over a period of at least 18 months (the latter half of 2014 & the whole of 2015) I feel that I can rely on them to continue as they are. Rather than set a goal such as "do yoga", it is more about what to do specifically during that session and how that fits in terms of what I am trying to achieve for the whole year. For example, I could be working towards a free standing handstand as a goal for the whole year but then work on certain exercises during June or July. Undertaking the RRtY challenge in Audax during 2015 has taught me how to stay focused for the whole year. I want to do this for all of my goals rather than just one or two. Doing RRtY also meant that I had sacrifice other things. I didn't really make a start on programming till much later in the year and to this end I was considering that I should perhaps remove one or two items from the list: not that they aren't important to me but that they don't need so much focus and can be followed in a less structured and more organic manner.</p>
<p>A compromise between removing goals entirely is to cut back from a more fervent approach to a milder one. With typing for example, which was put on hold while I did my 30 days of roller training, I could do it say 3 times a week and then have perhaps one or two months of the year when I practise more intensively and focus more fully.</p>
<p>Setting a more precise goal for my ongoing ones makes it seem more like a one-off goal but now that I'm getting older I suppose I'm starting to look at years more as a handful of months rather than a more substantial unit of time as I may have done in my younger days. A lot can be achieved in a year but I don't want to heap too much on my plate as it were as I know what is realistic and I want to leave room for entertainment, work and the opportunity for possible new passions such as Samaritans which came along unexpectedly halfway through 2015.</p>
<p>A one-off goal for 2016 is to find a part-time job to supplement my income. I'm increasing all of my rates but it will only just cover my costs. I thought a lot about finding this part-time job in 2015 but did nothing about it. I also have an idea of creating a web service which in theory could yield a small regular income. It may or may not work but I won't know that till I try.</p>
<p>Having left this plan for a couple of days after making a start I noticed that I am riding on a high after completing 2015 and feeling unstoppable. I don't want to undermine my confidence but at the same time I don't want to give myself too much so that there isn't room for the unexpected. There were periods in 2015 where I was slow to follow up with clients and I also spent many days putting things to one side and just gaming or watching movies. I want to and I need to make room for both the lazy and the industrious side of myself.</p>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
    <p>Maintenance or progress? Mainly maintenance. More or less a carry over from what I was doing in 2015 i.e. 2-3 times a week comprising of bodyweight exercises. Other than working with rings as well as the bar I have 2 particular moves that I want to accomplish which are called the muscle up and the lever. I want to work toward these during the year. Also my current sequence of exercises have progressions such that when the one that I'm doing becomes easy then I will introduce the one that is considered to be next level of difficulty. As before I will be tracking my training program on GitHub.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Diet</h4>
    <p>As a by product of my strength training I found some motivation to improve my diet in 2015 which took care of half of it. If we consider the week to be comprised of 21 meals then I have 11 of those covered and that leaves only 10 to consider. Two days are fasting and each breakfast of the non-fasting days is the same. Therefore my goal for the year is to find regular meals for those 10. I want to eat more lean protein to increase my muscle mass, eat more vegetables to work towards the 5-a-day advice in order to intake more fibre, vitamins and active enzymes and as far as possible cut out refined sugar, saturated fat and salt. Again it needs to be a compromise at least at the outset otherwise it could easily backfire. One idea that I had in 2015 was to batch cook ready meals so that when I was particularly hungry I wouldn't go into the kitchen and nibble on whatever was to hand because I didn't want to cook but could easily heat up something healthy that was frozen. My friend Luke who is a dietician recommended a simple way of creating a meal which was to have one third consisting of lean protein, one third of vegetables and the final third of complex whole grain carbohydrates. So it's just a question of creating a few meal ideas, ones that I like of course and having a few ready to go in the freezer.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Yoga practice</h4>
    <p>I'm loathed to set a list of postures and take away the spontaneous free-form and unstructured nature of my practice. In my reading goal I have set myself a list of books but I don't really want to do that with yoga except for perhaps one posture: the handstand. This posture crosses the boundary between strength training and yoga and rather than add it to my strength training routine I'm going to add it to my yoga session and keep the rest fairly organic. Even though in 2015 I have been stretching while watching movies or TV series doing whatever posture or stretch came to mind, I did maintain a regular routine and I did find that I gravitated toward certain moves. Perhaps once or even twice a week I could follow a more structured sequence just to see how that goes. Again just an idea rather than a goal. The main goal is to work toward a free standing hand stand and generally maintain a steady and regular practice.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Clearing Clutter</h4>
    <p>In 2015 I created a database with items that I wanted to discard with notes on each one and also the manner in which they were discarded. I don't know if I could reach a point where all that I wanted to discard had been discarded so this goal really is about maintenance and keeping track of things that need to go and making sure that they do go. I know that this goal can be a bit stop start but never stops completely and the urge to discard unloved or unused items is very much present so it is staying on the list. Remember though that clearing clutter is not only for physical items but also goals and ideas and possibly even friends and connections. Anything that is no longer relevant that needs to be pushed out of my life.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
    <p>I was toying with the idea of doing another RRtY as I managed to complete it in 2015. But this wasn't without its challenges: at times I really struggled and wanted to quit; my other goals had to be put to one side in order to achieve it. At first I thought about riding a double RRtY as they can be ridden in parallel i.e. 2 rides per month but each ride counting as one qualifying ride towards one RRtY. The idea was to ride one calendar ride and one permanent. But having studied the Audax calendar for 2016 and my own calendar I can't find many rides which I can actually attend. This would mean that I would have to ride a lot of perms as they are called and from my experience of riding three perms in 2015 I found them a bit tiresome especially when I had to ride them when I didn't really want to and under Audax conditions in order that they could be validated. I'm listing it as an idea rather than a goal in case I decide to take it up later on in the year as the RRtY challenge can be taken up at any time and doesn't need to start in January.</p>
    <p>However, in terms of actual goals that I do want to achieve this year is a SR or Super Randonneur. The challenge here is to complete a 200, 300, 400 and 600 km ride in the same season. In 2015 my goal was to ride a 300 and I did that and more so I don't think a 400 would pose a big challenge but the 600 will. In addition to this I am also organising my first Audax for Artisan Cycles. It'll be interesting to see things from the other side. One other goal this year would be to complete my FWC or Fixed Wheel Challenge. The challenge is to accrue 25 points and so far I have 22 so it's simply a case of riding a 300 and I'll be done.</p>
    <p>Obviously I'll need to train in between rides and since I'm not commuting as much as I used to this is going to be very important. Towards the end of 2015 I began to notice that I could get away with very little training between rides but ultimately I would like to be even more comfortable and also a little bit faster. How will I achieve this? At first I thought about using the RRtY as the training in itself but I really don't want that sort of pressure again. But I have friends who want to ride but don't want to ride such long distances so that would be a good compromise: they get to ride with me on a shorter distance and I go out on a ride where I might have thought that riding say 100km was not really worthwhile and ended up not riding at all.</p>
    <p>In addition to distance training which essentially means getting the miles in I would also like to get on the rollers twice a week and do intervals once a week.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>I've paid for Code School and I'm paid up until February 2017. I paid because Code School have some great courses and they are very engaging. I find that I can use the material that I learn for client work and that it is also very methodical. They have a curative approach and some great follow up material too. Paying should also give me an incentive to follow the courses after all I've handed over my money right? But it doesn't seem to work that way: it's a bit like food that I bought when I was out shopping which then remained in the fridge and eventually went off. Sad but true. So here is the plan.</p>
    <p>I'm going to focus on Javascript and on functional programming as a starting point. As well as the JS courses offered by Code School I would like also to follow the two Functional Javascript courses that I was working through last year. Version control is also very important so to this end I will also be following the Git courses on offer from Code School. On top of these for some fun and challenge I want to keep working through the Code Eval problems: it's a good way to apply what I'm learning to real world examples. Code School also said that they have a course they are launching called the MEAN stack: MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node. These are four components with which to build web applications and are all coded with Javascript and as such will tie in nicely with my main goal of learning Javascript properly and also my one-off goal of building an application.</p>
    <p>I could have set a goal of completing the whole of Code School and even though that may be possible in the course of a year I only want to set a main focus and then if I manage to get through that in less than a year or somehow I have managed to be very focused and find myself twiddling my thumbs then I will move on to Ruby or Rails for which they have a good amount of material.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Typing</h4>
    <p>Towards the end of 2015 I started to work at my typing again and found that I was averaging 52 wpm and an accuracy of 96%. What I found was that I was quite able to maintain this practice if I set a goal of doing it 2-3 times a week but if I had to do it every day I fell completely flat on my face. I'd like to set a goal of 75 wpm and say 98% accuracy by the end of the year but realistically I don't know if this is achievable. I'll set this as a goal anyway so that I have something to aim for but my main focus will remain on maintenance and becoming aware of where exactly I tend to make mistakes to work on my accuracy. I think that if I was more accurate my effective speed would increase.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>One of the things that broke the flow in 2015 was finishing one book and then looking for another to take its place. This year I'm planning to solve that issue by setting myself a list of books for the whole year: the entire works of Charles Dickens. Even though I am familiar of many of his works, especially as dramatisations, I can't remember actually reading any of them. I read David Copperfield as a child but a special children's edition and A Tale of Two Cities as a speed reading exercise. Dickens had a great influence on the English language and culture so I think this would be an interesting journey. It's not to say that I can't read anything else but given my recent history one book a month is what I'll probably manage and there is no sense in pushing myself to progress at a rate that is faster than this.</p>
    <p>As well as the list of books I would like to add things like speed reading, having a dedicated reading day each month and also keeping track of new words but I fear that this would make it far too time consuming and may kill the pleasure of reading in itself. I have included those ideas here so that I am reminded of them when I read this plan at the end of each month.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
    <p>The goal here is very much qualitative rather than quantitative even though I could set a goal of a certain number of shifts etc. rather like a sales target. But my main goal is to stick with it and keep going and gradually develop my experience. It's all too easy to burn out when you are over enthusiastic and then be forced to either pull out or take a break. I have committed myself to a minimum number of shifts in the same way that every Samaritan listening volunteer does but can also offer cover whenever that is required. What I'll need to do is to work out how many shifts on top of my minimum requirement I can safely offer my branch without compromising myself and thus not being there for my caller: they are the reason for the Samaritan volunteer in the first place and if we are burned out then we cannot offer them the service that they require.</p>
    <p>In terms of a monthly report obviously I cannot give any details of the calls due to the confidentiality policy but I will comment on how I feel about what I'm doing and my own progress generally.</p>
