<p>The start of April and I'm not really with it due to finishing the end of last month spending time in bed ill and now gradually recovering. It's also Easter time and the days that I take Maya have changed or rather that I'm not seeing her over the Easter weekend which again makes things appear odd as seeing Maya is such a regular feature in my life. But in that sense it's a break, a time to stop and reflect.</p>
<p>It's the 14th of the month so we are about halfway through and I feel that I am really catching up on all fronts. I have been getting my website work done which I have neglected for a long while, getting back on my bike after being ill at the end of last month and rebuilding my enthusiasm for programming and computing so it's all very exciting.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>The first week has been a recovery week with zero on the first day, then a cut down session on the 2nd and then sub-maximal on the third i.e. not able to reach the rep counts that I have been reaching recently. Shows how hard the illness hit me.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p>This month I have been keeping track of the amount of vegetables and fruit that I'm consuming each day using the 5-a-day system as my guide. Today is the 9th of April and so far I can see that my average is around two. Which means a distinct lack of food items that count towards my 5-a-day intake. Yesterday I had a celebratory meal, my first 1500 mile meal which was taken at the Wagamama restaurant. The meal did contain a good amount of vegetables but immediately afterwards I consumed sugary desserts and a cut price chocolate egg. Very soon after that I shared a bag of chips with Maya. It was a highly enjoyable non-fasting day but it seems that I haven't exhausted my love of junk food and it may take more than a food log to introduce more fruit and veg into my diet.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>During the few days of my illness I practiced yoga in bed which I thought was commendable given my general lack of energy. This shows that I am indeed motivated.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p>Two old rims sawed up and binned today. They had been sitting around and watching me for a long time. I had laced them to check if they could be re-used but both were beyond that point.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>So far, today being the 9th I haven't been riding at all. This is slightly worrying as I have a big ride tomorrow, in fact the biggest I have ever done, a 300km ride but having been recuperating from my illness and then taking it easy following a full body deep tissue massage on the 5th I think that I may not have lost too much fitness since my last ride as I have still been commuting. The amount of riding has been low but hasn't been zero.</p>
<p>Starting at one mintue past midnight on the 11th of the month I did my first audax ride of the month. I plan to do more. It was my first night ride and also my first 300km ride. I rode it fixed gear mainly to be able to use my pannier in order to carry plenty of food. In the end I found that I didn't need it but it was still nice to have my more familiar bike and to use the newer ratio that I've been using for my commuting. I want to write a separate longer post about this ride so I'll keep it brief and cover only the highlights. I finished in a very good time of 15h 8mins which is incredible for me as I normally complete a 200km ride in just under 12 hours. Really enjoyed riding through the night and am now keen to have a go at the Dunwich Dynamo and probably others too. Not too tired or achy after the ride at least not half as much as I had expected and my RRtY requirement for this month is done. I have also accrued another 3 months for my FWC or Fixed Wheel Challenge so I need to check that to see how close I am to getting the 25 points.</p>

<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p>Been looking at the courses on the Pragmatic Studio website. They look very similar to the Code School courses in that they have instructional video lectures followed by accompanying exercises. However, they are a lot more expensive compared to Code School. Not entirely outside of my price range, however I wouldn't want to pay the price and then find I lose motivation or time. The focus is mainly on Ruby and Rails. In some ways I'm excited about Ruby since doing the Programming Languages course and understanding it's functional side but it also feels like a throwback to 2009 when I first got on this home study of programming trying to learn Ruby and Rails. Perhaps six years on it will come more easily and also be more rewarding especially as the technology has matured a lot and my general programming knowledge and skills have improved a great deal too.</p>
<p>As well as watching the videos from the Pragmatic Studio series I have also been reading from the book Functional Javascript both of which is inspiring me to do more study. I keep telling myself that the reason that I haven't been doing it is because I've been riding or that I have a lot of work to do but I still have time on my hands and if I am genuinely enthused about something then I'll find a way to fit it in.</p>

<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I've started reading The Time Machine by H G Wells and since it is a short work I think that I should be able to complete it well inside the month time frame and also complete my other choice of Three Men in a Boat. I think I have already mentioned these books in my previous report but I'm excited at the thought of actually catching up to my one book a month goal. Of the ones that have been lacking this is really picking up again and I hope to do some audio book recording his month too.</p>
<p>I've now (9th) finished the Time Machine and am well on my way into the Three Men in a Boat book. It's laugh out loud funny and makes a change from the others that I've been reading. It was recommended as a classic by Amazon readers which is why I chose it and I'm glad that I did. It reminds me of a previous strategy that I had for reading which was to alternate between high and low brow literature.</p>
<p>Now that the weather is getting warmer and the sun is finally coming out I have bought myself a deck chair so that I can sit and read comfortably in the garden.</p>
