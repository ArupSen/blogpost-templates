<p>It's the 5th of September and I feel a bit behind as I'm only starting this months report today and I haven't put out last month's report just yet. But then what does it really matter. I mean it goes on my blog and apart from me there are only a handful of people that read it, if that. But I've been doing it for a long time on a regular basis and it has become a habit and I tend to feel out of sorts if I don't do it. Is it a crutch? Perhaps that's not the best analogy more like healthy food or general training that keeps me on the ball. By writing these reports I look back over the recent past and reflect back to myself how I'm doing.</p>
<p>Here we are on the 22nd of September and the month seems to be flying by but the main thing is that I seem to be getting on with things and not too worried about what I'm doing and not doing. I'm getting into the programming which is really pleasing.</p>
<p>Into the final weeks of the month now and even though I'm feeling overloaded I am making good progress on most fronts. Pleased in some ways and frustrated in other ways. Sometimes, when things are going well, rather than focusing on that I seem to start turning my attention to the things that aren't going well. From a business point of view I guess this would be a good strategy; trying to bring everything up to the highest level but on a more personal level it could easily undermine confidence. I even start to wish that the progress that I have made was greater. It's a very black and white view and doesn't cater for the incremental approach and that everything is a work in progress. I should look at how far I have come in the past couple of years rather than how I could have gone or should have gone. I will progress at a rate that I progress and that cannot be rushed. Perhaps there is some sort of fast track method that I haven't come across yet but even that isn't necessary; what's important is the attitude; that I treat myself as a human being rather than a commodity or subject of some experiment.</p>

<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>August has been carried over into September and my current workout of three supersets is working rather well. I often think back to the days when I could barely do one pull-up and in this workout I'm doing 10 sets of 5 or a total of 50! That is way beyond the expectations I would have had at the time and now it's just normal.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Sunday 21st, I was at the park with Maya and it was a very pleasant day and now there are lots of exercise stations at Mayow Park I decided to have a go at them. I mainly focused on pull-ups and dips. The metal bars are tough on the hands so it felt very sore afterwards but as well as doing the main exercises I also had a go at the monkey bars and various climbing apparatus that the kids were using. Pushed myself pretty hard so decided to skip my usual session on the Monday. I'm really keen now to be able to do the muscle up and various other street workout moves.</p>
<p>Went to the park on Friday 25th and did a full workout outdoors. It was warm and sunny and I felt fit. But my strength was very much put to the test as the effort to complete the session was a lot greater than it is at home. I imagine that I pushed myself harder as there were people watching and the bar was a touch thicker than the one I have at home. No padding either. The callouses on my hands are really building up.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p>For a week or so I had lots of veggies from the market and used them to prepare meals but once they were gone and the weather got a bit cooler I've gone back to junk food. Now that I'm getting into the strength training a bit more perhaps I will start eating more protein and consider what will help me to get ripped and build muscle. I'm not a big meat eater so I guess it'll be tuna and eggs but that isn't a bad thing as it will stop me eating the fatty and sugary stuff that normally attracts me.</p>
<p>I've been adding a bit of extra protein to my diet by having scrambled eggs for breakfast in addition to my toast and then adding more at other times by using tuna and cottage cheese. But as I've mentioned already, I don't want to move over to a body building diet.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>Still keeping it up and seem to have settled into a format which is doing something quite freeform along with watching something. It's actually better when I don't watch something but haven't managed to wean myself off that. I'm staying with it which I guess is the main thing. Perhaps getting the countdown going again might help to keep me focused.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p>It's on the list but doesn't seem much of a priority at the moment. I have done a lot over the course of the year so it doesn't bother me too much but then again I am bothered so there is that.</p>
<p>Keep noticing things that should go but haven't been adding them to the list so it's about time I did.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>It's the 13th of September and the day after an Audax ride. Probably the hardest ride that I've ridden this year but it had to be done as it was the only calendar ride that would have fitted into my schedule. 300km and extremely hilly with 4.5 AAA or Audax Altitude Award points. I'll write a separate more detailed post about it. I haven't done any other rides this month even for training and now that this one is done and my RRtY quota for this month done I am free to ride or not ride. Hopefully I'll get another long ride in this month though. I had my eye on a calendar ride on the 26th of the month called Cheddar Gorgeous but have a Samaritans shift on that date.</p>
<p>Since that Greenwich Mean Climb ride on the 12th I haven't done much in the way of riding and training. Hopefully this week, weather pending, I will get another ride in.</p>
<p>The first longish ride since the 12th was on the 23rd which was just up to Much Hadham and back. Compared to the 300km ride it wasn't much as the total came to only about 130km but compared to what I used to ride last year it's quite a contrast. Firstly I did the 3 hour ride in one sitting without a break. I didn't feel any aches and pains thought of it just like a commute.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p>I signed to part 2 of Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python from Rice University as I did Part 1 a couple of years ago but as expected I haven't really found the time to devote myself to it. Hopefully the next offering though. In the meantime I have been tying up many other jobs and projects so that I can focus a bit more on my programming studies. I have been doing Code School courses, Code Eval problems, watching lectures and tutorials on functional aspects of javascript and reading 'You don't know JS'. I'm into it, I'm really into it.</p>
<p>The Python course with Rice University didn't happen. Well, what I mean to say is that it didn't happen for me. But that is not to say that I did no programming. In fact I've been doing a good deal of Code Eval problems and generally reading about Javascript and browsing the function reference on MDN or Mozilla Developer Network. I don't care if it will or will not lead to work: I'm enjoying it and I'm purely following my interest and making time for it. I've realised that I sometimes make it into a sort of ceremony and make it too special and then it gets put off till later and later in the day. So I just make a start and then end up doing a lot more.</p>
<p>More Javascript coding has led me to Nodejs. I seem to be hopping around a bit from one thing to the other but at the moment I seem to be sticking to Javascript. Still very much enjoying it.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>When I stopped doing this a few months ago I had the excuse of freeing time to do roller training but I no longer have that excuse. The reminder still goes off on my phone which of course makes me think about it so I think I'll gradually drift back into it this month. But no pressure as I'm fairly happy with my speed at the moment but the accuracy could do with some work.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>Having missed reading altogether during the last few days of August and pretty much the first few days of September too I have started up again today on the 7th. Still reading the Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne. The style is very different to any that I have read before but has some allure. I should imagine that I will continue with this till the end, either of the book or the month. I've set a Reading Day for this month on the 13th, something that has been missed many times this year. Hopefully, being on a day following a ride might allow me to just chill out and read.</p>
<p>Today is the 13th but Reading Day didn't really happen. I was far more tired than I had expected after the ride and didn't manage to sleep well. I did manage to read for my usual half an hour but that was about all. I am enjoying the book but wanted to have a more general day off and allow myself to be distracted by distraction. Think I'll have to assign another day this month as it would be nice to have a proper reading day.</p>
<p>The reading hasn't been going well at all this month and has suffered neglect. I think I got used to the Jack Reacher books and miss them. I think that if they get me to read then next month I should go back to them. Looking at my hour logs for the activities that I'm tracking this year this month has seen a lot of zeros.</p>
