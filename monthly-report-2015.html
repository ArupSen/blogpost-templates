<p>Day one, the first of Jan. A blank file set up and ready for filling with some good reports.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>Missed a session on Wednesday (7th) due to doing a long cycle ride but managed to increase my rep count on all exercises today (9th) so I'm very happy with that.</p>

<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>The first and probably the only opportunity to ride a 200km audax this month will be the one on the 17th called the Willy Warmer. I'm planning to get myself on that one and have started training. Today, the 2nd, a Friday, I did a non-stop 40 mile / 60 km ride down in Kent. It's one that I've ridden before and comes from the bigfoot.cc website. Country lanes with some rolling hills. What I'll need to do is to ride this route again but at night with my new dynamo lights which are yet to arrive. The sun sets around 4.00pm at the moment and I think that I will probably have this distance left to ride after that. The other thing that I need to do is to work on getting up early as the ride starts at 08:00 and I've been getting up well after that.</p>
<p>More training today on the 7th with a 100km ride into Kent and Surrey. There were some very tough long climbs and some sections with headwinds. My toes were frozen in spite of two pairs of socks and even tin foil. I had overshoes too. The rest of me was fairly warm, especially on those climbs. Didn't take many stops as it was too cold but felt fairly comfortable at the end. Left the house at just before 10.00 and was home a little after 3.00. Could I do two of those back to back? Probably. But I'll need to do some of it in the dark so I still need to do the dynamo training. I've now built up a dynamo wheel and my lights have arrived too so possibly Sunday evening. Exciting.</p>

<p>I started reading Moby Dick in December 2014 and am continuing with that through January of 2015. I've also set a date for the reading day - it coincides with a fasting day.</p>
