<p>Gosh, January flew by and here we are on the 4th of February. Wow. But so far I've already done one audax ride on the 1st. Woo hoo.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>I have updated my program so that now the rep counts are all a little bit higher and the triceps dips have been replaced by dips between chairs which is a bit harder. Just what I needed. The updated workout is up on my Github in a repo called workout.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p>Had a brand new bluetooth mouse sitting in the cupboard for at least a year that never got used. Sold it on ebay for &pound;43.00 which was a lot more than I had hoped to get for it. I have also put on a top that I got for xmas last year that is brand new and unused as well as my old iphone 4 now that I have the new iPhone 6.</p>

<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>As I've mentioned above, on the 1st of February I rode the Windrush Winter Warmup 100km ride in the Cotswolds. I had already ridden it before in 2013 but remember that I found it very tough going at the time and also remember that there were hills to climb.  When I had finished I was quite exhausted and my legs were wobbly when coming down the stairs. However, on this occasion I found it so much easier. In the first instance I was using a GPS device which made the navigation far easier. I did ride the same fixed gear bike but didn't find it in any way a struggle and could easily have ridden further. Initially the weather was looking as though there would be ice and snow but that soon cleared and there was soft winter sunshine pretty much all day. It was indeed cold but certainly bearable. The hardest obstacle was the wind and during the second leg of the ride there were headwinds for all of the 32km. The first leg on the other hand was with a tailwind and like most people I rode a non-stop 47km. There was tea and cake at each stop and no info controls which kept it very simple. The start was at 09:00 and I came in at 14:30 ish. I didn't push it but did try and make the most of the downhill sections in the third leg especially to make up for the tough riding during the second stage. I was staying with friends who live only 10 minutes ride away from the start / finish so went back there for a couple of hours before making my way home: Kemble to London Paddington by train then the final cycle of the day from Paddington home. Felt tired but not all exhausted and hungry for more.</p>
<p>After the audax on the first I didn't do any big rides till the 11th of February. I did a training ride to Brighton and back. It was a cold and cloudy day but there was no rain. I rode fixed again and used a route that I've ridden many times before except for one change which avoided the "offroad" section. I left at around 08:30 and didn't stop till I reached Cuckfield which was about 3 hours ride. I felt so comfortable that I had the crazy idea of riding the whole way without stopping. I checked my phone messages and found that my friend would be available for lunch at 13:00 if I managed to arrive at that time. I ate the peanut butter sandwich that I had packed and set off again. I arrived at 13:03. I caught up with my friends, took lunch and then began the journey home. There was a whole lot of traffic on the return leg which really spoiled the experience. I shan't be doing it again. I was surprised at how easy I found it and wasn't too tired the following day which is a regular yoga teaching day.</p>

<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p>Having neglected programming pretty much all the way throughout January I aim to get at least a minimal amount of hours. I had a look at my plan for the year and will pick up where I left off in December with the ruby koans, using ruby to solve the CodeEval challenges and generally using ruby for utility apps.</p>
<p>I was thinking of the idea of having a programming day in the same way that I've been having a reading day or a day out on a ride. That day is fully dedicated to that particular activity and currently there is nothing in place for programming.  Would be a good way to boost the hours.</p>
<p>I've also been thinking about a Code School subscription. It's about &pound;190.00 for the year. Not a great deal to spend compared to the &pound;300.00 that I spent on only one term with City University for the Java Programming course that I attended a few years ago. Perhaps putting down some money and subscribing to a course might motivate me to get my programming hat on again.</p>

<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>Did the reading day yesterday (9th) and a bit like last month it was a bit distracted. I did manage to do a fair bit of reading but having looked at the actual hours that I logged it was only 2.25 hours of actual reading. This is obviously a lot more than the half an hour a day that is planned for the daily goal but still a lot fewer hours than I had anticipated. But it shows that I hadn't planned well. I did go to the park for half an hour but it was a bit too cold to stay longer. I worked when I got home and then worked in the evening. I think that if I had taken more time to plan then I would have chosen a caf√© to go to and also done it on a day when I would have been home in the evening too. Still, it's a new beginning as I didn't do it at all last year and didn't read at all in the latter half of January.</p>
