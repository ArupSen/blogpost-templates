<p>I have now been riding Audax since late 2012 and apart from a few mentions under the heading of riding and training in my monthly reports I haven't said anything about it. I've been gradually increasing my distances since my first 100km ride (which was in fact 120km and also very hilly). Last year(2014) my plan was to make the 200km my base distance and then work up from there. But last year I incurred a wrist injury after a fall and that meant some time off the bike which really broke my confidence and so in spite of getting back into riding later on in the year I wasn't able to follow that plan. This year however I made an early start in January with a plan to ride what is known in the Audax world as RRtY or Randonneur Round the Year. In order to achieve this honour a rider has to complete a minimum of a 200km ride each month for 12 consecutive months. The 300km ride in which I took part (and completed) was on the 11th of April and was my fourth of the year.</p>
<p>Based on the ride prior to this one called the LOL or London Oxford London which was a 200km ride but where I rode to and from the start making it more like 260km I thought that it wouldn't really be much further to make it a 300km ride so I thought that perhaps I was ready.</p>
<p>The first thing to figure out with this ride as with any ride are the logistics. How to get there, how to get back, how much food to take with me and other than actual controls where to stop and take breaks. This one was due to start at one minute past midnight so absolutely no problems with trains early in the morning on a Sunday but the food side of things did worry me. Riding at night meant that shops wouldn't be open and I would have to take food with me, which was essentially why I decided to ride this one fixed. That bike is the one on which I commute so it's also more familiar and also has the rack and pannier. A little heavier than the other bike but give me peace of mind. The route was pretty flat and this year I had already ridden a couple of 200km rides on fixed gear so I wasn't worried.</p>
<p>My rough plan was to have kebab or similar take away on the train as the journey would be an hour. But having arrived at the station earlier than I had expected I decided to take a train that got me to Manningtree from Liverpool Street half an hour earlier. When I arrived I noticed how quiet a place it was with a distinct lack of shops. I rode from the station to the village (and that was all it was) to find all the shops already closed it being after 23:00 so I went to where most of the other early arrivals were waiting which was the Moghul curry house. There were a great many bikes parked outside and I wished then that I had arrived earlier to join them. Perhaps next year if I wanted to ride this one again. But I did the next best thing which was to get a take away. I ordered whatever would be easy and got samosas and onion bhajis along with a 1.5 litre bottle of diet coke.</p>
