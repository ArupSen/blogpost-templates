<p>We kick off March on the first of the month and after two weeks or so of feeling under the weather I feel back on track and raring to go. Some of the goals from last month are being carried forward because I didn't get a chance to work on them or simply put them off.</p>
<p>Starting from this month one major change has occurred which is that I have a new lodger. I wasn't too happy with my previous lodger. He made a lot of noise and didn't really clean up after himself. I got tired of having to tell him about it and found that a friend needed a place to live and wasn't too happy in his place of abode. I hope now that the home environment will be a lot more supportive and conducive to harmonious living and the one unpleasant feature in my life has been eliminated.</p>
<p>At the halfway point I'm engaged with half of my goals and not so much with the other half. I'm very much into gaming and generally relaxing due to the relaxed atmosphere after the new lodger having moved in and a carry over of the illness from the previous month. Strength training, diet, typing and reading seem to be racing ahead while cycling, yoga, clutter clearing and programming drop behind. More details in each section. As for gaming I have been very engrossed with Fallout Shelter which I've been playing on my iPad and iPhone. Along with this I've been playing a game called Crackdown on the Xbox. I've also been watching playthrough videos on YouTube and looking into a possible next generation console upgrade but for now I'll stick with my Xbox 360 and work through the back catalogue of great games that I've missed. I've been collating a list of these games which I can buy for around 3.00 GBP on eBay: a handful of coins for many hours of entertainment.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>Essentially carry over what I've been doing in February. In some of the exercises I am close to being able to perform 3 x 8 repetitions which means I would be then ready to progress to the next level of difficulty. I do want to be able to perform those reps with very good style before moving on rather than try to jump ahead in a slap dash manner.</p>
<p>Going very well both in terms of progress and engagement. I did miss one day due to very low energy but other than that I have been doing it every Monday, Wednesday and Friday between 11.30 and 12.30 roughly. It's great and I'm really loving it.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Diet</h4>
<p>The goal for this month already started in February which was to base my diet around a protein target of 60g per day: 20g per meal. It's an experimental idea in that it will be a six week trial period.</p>
<p>This one is going well too and other than a couple of lapses it's great knowing that I simply need to eat protein and building my next meal around that. I've been fairly content eating tuna salads at lunchtimes which gives me both the protein and the required amount of veg. It's tasty too but doesn't stop me from eating cakes and chocolates and all manner of junk food but as I've already explained many times: my aim is not to entirely quit these foods but to create a nutritional balance as well as an emotional balance so that I can ingest the foods that I need as well as the foods that I crave.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Yoga practice</h4>
<p>What I need to do is to get back to my handstand practice and even though I'm working on postures every session I need to come up with a routine that I can follow every now and then where I am actively working on certain postures. In the strength training I am working with exercises with progressive levels of difficulty and perhaps I could do the same with yoga. For example I could have one for forward bends, backbends, sidebends and twists, then find the appropriate level for my current ability.</p>
<p>This one isn't going too well. I even missed it a few times. A definite lack of enthusiasm and engagement coupled with some genuine excuses such as lack of time and lack of energy. But the desire to continue is very much present and I know that yoga will be in my life for many years to come.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing Clutter</h4>
<p>I had the idea of putting together the items that I would consider discarding for each room or section of the flat. At least then they would be on display and perhaps remind me that they need to go.</p>
<p>Not really sure where I'm at with this. My first inclination was to say that I'm not doing very well because I haven't added much to the list of discarded items but I do have a strong sense of it being an ongoing process find that it is on my mind a lot of the time. Bringing together items that are destined for expulsion certainly helps.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>Having had a 2 week break from riding in general let alone long rides I have to rebuild my fitness and work towards my next Audax ride on the 13th of March. I'm not sure if I want to still work at the double RRtY but let's say I ride the calendar Audax on the 13th and then a perm and I'll see how I feel about it after that.</p>
<p>I booked myself on to the London-Oxford-London ride but when it came to the day before which was as Saturday I decided that I didn't actually want to do it. I wanted to spend the day at home and didn't want to get up early and be out on the road on my bike. I thought that I would be a lot more disappointed with myself for having done this but I just wanted to break the RRtY mentality and move more into the spirit of riding because I really wanted to ride. Last year there were at least three ride as far as I can remember where I didn't really want to ride but if I had chosen to miss those rides then I would not have achieved my RRtY goal. I'm pleased with myself with having completed the challenge but I really rather not have to do it again. Having missed February due to illness I thought I could pick it up again in March but what I really want is to be able to ride and when I feel like it rather than fulfilling any sort of quota.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming</h4>
<p>I didn't get anywhere with my goals last month but I did make a start on the Code School course ES 2015, so what I'll do is to work toward finishing that one and leave it open as to what else I do.</p>
<p>Seems to have been totally sidelined as though it is not even on the list. What have I done this month with regard to this goal? Not much other than watch a few videos and play around a little but as with the cycling I know that I want to enjoy this learning and I don't want to feel under pressure so I think that it will make a come back at same stage.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>I thought about trying another tutor and perhaps starting again from scratch but I'm not sure if that would help. I think I will just continue with what I've been doing but simply focus more on accuracy rather than speed this month and stay aware of the types of mistakes that I'm making.</p>
<p>Surprisingly this is going rather well! This month I have been working on my accuracy and slowing down a little in order to achieve that and the result has been with the pressure taken away from speed I seem to be more engaged with the process and have been doing more than my 2 session a week quota.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I'm almost done with Oliver Twist as I'm now at 93% so once that is complete I will move on to the next book Nicholas Nickleby.</p>
<p>Really enjoying Nicholas Nickleby. It's an exciting book with great characters and a story that is far from sluggish. The language is rich and engrossing and one can really feel the atmosphere of any scene.</p>
<li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
<p>One shift so far and that was on the 1st of March. I got a bit wet riding there but the shift itself went very smoothly and I ate a good amount of biscuits: probably the only time in the week that I consume biscuits. Good to work with a volunteer that I haven't worked with before.</p>
<p>I've had another overnight session on Tuesday 15th March and it was a very busy night. I hovered between answering phone calls and SMS calls. I wouldn't say that I've got it down pat yet but with some types of calls I feel very comfortable and confident and then there are others where I just don't know how to handle them. Apparently everyone goes through this process and there comes a point where they feel comfortable with the majority of call types such as genuine distress, time wasters, those that seem to be wanting to chat but actually aren't ready to talk about the true nature of their distress, the regular callers and the very long emails too. At a certain stage it all sort of becomes natural and flows without any sense of doubt: I look forward to reaching that level. Some say it took them a year to get there and others say it was two. I don't mind how long it takes but in the meantime I know that what I'm doing is helping people and so is also helping me.</p>
<li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
<p>Last month my goal was to send emails to wheel builders to gather information about my idea and see how many people would use it and whether it would be worth creating. Speaking to a friend I said that I'm being a bit lazy about it and that the sooner I can get hold of this information the sooner I can move: make a start or quit.</p>
<p>Well, no progress at all on the remote work / job search front and my idea of creating a wheel tracking service hasn't progressed very far either. Ah well.</p>
