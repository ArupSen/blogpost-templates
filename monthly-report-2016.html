<p>The start of September feels like the end of the summer holidays and getting back to work. I have only just completed the August report having not set any goals and neglected any ongoing reporting. This month I'm keen to get going with my goals and have a clear idea of what I want to achieve this month. I also want to keep a closer eye on what I'm doing and how well I'm progressing through the month. This months report could therefore end up becoming fairly long.</p>
<p>Only three days later I feel that I have a lot to say but not really: I just feel that I am keeping track of it all and that I'm staying excited about it. I have printed off my list of goals for the month, which is something that I haven't done before and it keeps reminding me of what I am planning to accomplish this month. I'll keep adding short reports.</p>
<p>On the 8th and 9th I had a little downtime due to feeling totally exhausted. On the 8th I had to go out and teach after having woken up with severe cramp in my left calf. It made it hard to ride and quite difficult to teach classes but somehow I managed. On the Friday, the 9th, I was so exhausted I had to just rest and that was a big change to what I had planned.</p>
<p>The exhaustion and cramping in the calves continued over the weekend which caused me to essentially drop everything and behave as though I was sick. I spent most of Saturday watching TV series and due to the sunshine I spent much of the afternoon in the garden. In the morning I went to Lewisham on the bus with the intention of going to Greenwich to catch Pokemon but after only a few steps out of the bus I turned about and headed home.</p>
<p>So it's more than halfway through the month and six days have passed since the last report. I have more or less lost all of the initial enthusiasm and clarity that I had at the start of the month. Feels like the rug has been pulled from under me and I'm left wondering where the focus has gone. I realise how much of a house of cards this life can be. Been watching TV, missing things and generally being lazy. There were some very warm days which I imagine were the final days of the summer so I took advantage of them but along with that leisure there was guilt and disappointment.</p>
<p>It seems then that since the last update which was around the 18th of the month I haven't looked at it and just scanning briefly the printed sheet of specific goals for the month under the headings of the ongoing goals I can see that I started the month very strong with a great deal of enthusiasm and I have gone completely the opposite way. I have been eating junk food, watching TV and generally neglecting as much as possible. I put it down to the calf cramp at the start of the month along with the bouts of total exhaustion. The cramps didn't occur again but I did experience the exhaustion a few times. It's another lesson in the belief that no matter how well laid your plans may be, in the great scheme of things your plans not more than a house of cards. It's been partly an enjoyable experience simply entertaining myself a great deal but not entirely guilt free.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>Continue with the Reddit recommended routine. Focus on better form and dipping into the next level.</p>
<p>On Monday 5th I did another session following the Friday 2nd where I was again fasting and didn't use my yoghurt and banana pre-workout snack but felt equal to the task nevertheless. Don't know what is happening with the dips as they keep going up and down.</p>
<p>Another great session on the 7th where I didn't feel too keen at the start. But it was a hot day which made things easier and the final sets of exercises seemed to be very comfortable so probably need to be upgraded.</p>
<p>Completely missed strength training the week following the weekend where I didn't ride. At first I thought I would miss just one and then I missed the 2nd and then finally the 3rd. It was strange and seemed so easy to justify it.</p>
<p>In the final week of the month I did a session on the Monday but then missed the Wednesday as it was the day after a big ride which is justifiable but then went on to miss the Friday session as well.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Diet</h4>
<p>Try the August approach again: Keeping track with myfitnesspal, follow a meal plan, no snacks but a touch more lenient.</p>
<p>Over the 3rd and 4th which was a weekend when I had Maya staying with me I did go slightly over my allowance but not much and I did eat a bit more junk food but it wasn't excessive in the way it may have been in the past. She also wasn't too bothered about not having too much chocolate or snacks.</p>
<p>On Thursday 8th I had a gap between classes and resorted to consuming junk food and then on Friday 9th, my usual fasting day I skipped it because I was so exhausted that day and enjoyed some comfort food comprising of samosas, jalebi and crumpets. I don't regret it but on Saturday 10th I am resuming with my typical fast.</p>
<p>Having fasted on Saturday I did enjoy some more junk food on the Sunday. I allowed myself this because I wasn't feeling my best and needed some comfort.</p>
<p>Junk food is back with a vengeance. Lots of chips and have lost touch with my healthy eating plan and my protein plan. The protein thing didn't seem to be doing much anyway and many times the tuna salad which I had put in place as my standard lunch gave me the shits many many times.</p>
<p>Hearing about the recipes that my clients have been cooking reminds me of how much I used to cook and also shows me that following a fairly strict diet which comprises of much the same meals is not something that I can sustain for very long which I think is another reason why I have crashed and burned with my eating plan: it's not all about junk food; I want the freedom to eat what I want when I want; I have the fasting in place to take care of the weight gain issues but the rest of the time I want to enjoy an unrestricted freedom.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Yoga practice</h4>
<p>Sessions without any screen time so only audio if required such as music, podcasts, audio books or radio. Use a timer for poses, focus on breathing, do an advanced version of Rich's program as he is away during September. Handstands on non-workout days.</p>
<p>From the 2nd to the 5th I've done yoga without any distraction, holding postures for a given time (one minute so far) and employing deep breathing. It's been great and I felt more focused and engaged as though I was on a solitary retreat.</p>
<p>I missed yoga on the 7th due to Samaritans in the evening and hadn't structured my day in order to cater for that. I also missed it on Friday 9th when I essentially dropped everything.</p>
<p>On Saturday and Sunday I did no yoga but did a focused session on Monday.</p>
<p>Missed many sessions these past few days. I mean I could have done even 10-15 minutes but just didn't want to stop what I was doing in order to do yoga. After the cramp and exhaustion that stopped me from riding I figured that I needed to rest and so I did but in a big way.</p>
<p>I missed one or two sessions but went back to my distracted practice but at least it was something.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing Clutter</h4>
<p>Sell my extra bike parts and throw out any worn out bits in the wheel room.</p>
<p>2nd September threw out packaging and worn items such as a sawn up rim and spoke pieces.</p>
<p>I've taken some photos of a set of handlebars and saved them as a draft on eBay.</p>
<p>As of the 12th still nothing on eBay but hoping.</p>
<p>Aside from this plan of selling these old handlebars on eBay I haven't really done much else. Still haven't put them on ebay and keep thinking about what I should get rid of but I'm not actually getting rid of stuff. So fucking frustrating.</p>
<p>I took the photos and made a draft auction but that was as far as I got. Shame.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>Complete 2 x 200 plus rides. The Flatlands 600 is already booked for the 10th. Rollers at least once a week.</p>
<p>2nd September had a 20 minute roller session with no specific aims other than to ride.</p>
<p>Had another 15 minute roller session on the 3rd while Maya was here. Great warm up to yoga and also proved to myself that I can do it while Maya is here.</p>
<p>Due to the cramping calves and exhaustion on Thursday 8th I cancelled my plans to travel to Much Hadham on Friday 9th where I was due to stay over prior to my ride on Saturday 10th, the Flatlands 600. As well as feeling physically unwell there was rain forecast for Saturday so I have no regrets. It's a shame to miss the opportunity to complete my fixed wheel super randonneur but I can always try next year. I would still like to continue with my double parallel RRtY challenge which means that I will need to ride 2 x 200km rides this month. If I am to get the 40@40 badge then I'll need to ride at least one.</p>
<p>Hardly rode my bike at all from the 12th to the 18th and that leaves only 12 days to get a 200km ride done. It would be such a shame to be so close and not complete the 40@40 challenge but at the moment neither the mind nor the body are willing.</p>
<p>Well here is one goal where I did succeed. It doesn't feel as good as expected. I mean sure, I do feel pretty chuffed but it still feels a bit like a box tick and in general I feel more relieved than elated. It's good to know that I will be among a select few who will receive this award but it's equally good to know that I can now rest a bit and not worry about points.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming</h4>
<p>Code school mobile design courses to help me build a responsive Racer Rosa website and also my wheelbuilding site.</p>
<p>2nd September started on the HTML / CSS path in Code School. Should be able to cruise through it fairly quickly as the material is totally familiar but should hopefully pick up some new ideas.</p>
<p>Over the weekend of the 3/4th I have completed the Front End Foundations course and most of the Front End Formations course on Code School. The first one was very basic and in a way wasn't necessary but the second one gave some good updates on HTML5 and CSS3. I can make my code a lot more semantic using the new tags that I haven't been using and I can use CSS3 to do the job of JS where those rules are supported.</p>
<p>Over the 6th and 7th I completed CSS Cross Country and managed to glean a few tips and techniques. After that I went on to watch a couple of "Watch Us Build" video follow ups which showed how to use material from those three courses. Again most of it wasn't new to me but there were ideas and practices that I would be able to use in my own work. I have some good ideas on how to refactor and update my Static Site Starter framework to HTML5.</p>
<p>I'm more or less done with the Journey into Mobile course which goes into making websites Adaptive and Responsive. That will make it four courses. What I haven't been doing is taking notes which is something that I will do once I've finished the one that I'm on. I haven't been taking notes because I feel that this is all review but there are things here that are new to me.</p>
<p>Having completed the Journey into Mobile course on Sunday I reviewed a course I did a while ago called Breaking the Ice with Regular Expressions. I remember how inspired I was by that course and how it got me back into Code School at the time. It all came back to me and I spent some time playing with <a href="http://regex101.com>regex101.com">regex101.com</a> and worked out a way of stripping out <ele> and <time> tags from .gpx files.</p>
<p>Thought a little about the things that I would need to change on my own site to make it more mobile friendly and did some more more regex exercises but didn't do another course.</p>
<p>I kept up my love of regex till the end of the month and tried it out in many situations and really enjoyed getting to have a better feel for it.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>Add a third session on top of my current two (or more) per week for 'burst' sessions where the focus is entirely on speed.</p>
<p>I've been doing my regular sessions but still haven't had a burst session and it's now the 10th.</p>
<p>I missed my session on Sunday which is something that I've been doing the past few weeks but make it up on the Monday but this time I missed that too.</p>
<p>The burst session still hasn't happened but I did manage to do my two regular weekly sessions. I did notice that my speed has actually gone down a few wpm. May just be Sod's Law that just when I think about increasing my speed it goes down.</p>
<p>The burst session didn't happen and my average speed did go down a touch but only a touch.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>Read 2 books this month and then possibly continue till the end of the year if it works this month. I spend a lot of time on TV, movies and gaming: could I move that time to reading?</p>
<p>On the 1st I completed Barnaby Rudge and purchased Martin Chuzzlewit. It has 54 chapters which I need to cover in 2 weeks or 14 days which is roughly 4 chapters a day: a great deal more than I'm used to reading!</p>
<p>I managed to read a lot over the weekend, certainly more than I would normally especially when I have Maya here but it still wasn't enough to cover 4 chapters in a day. I worked out that it takes me almost an hour to read a chapter from this book and therefore to read for four hours to complete my task is far more than I can commit each day. I found myself struggling with head nodding and also getting distracted. The craving for screen time was strong especially having done so much of it so freely over the course of August but I did manage to limit it. This challenge is definitely a bit unrealistic but I'll go on with it just to see how far I get and how I respond to it.</p>
<p>I managed to read for a good 2 hours on the 6th but even though I had time later on I used it to watch TV series instead. I do enjoy screen time and it will take some time to wean myself off it.</p>
<p>On the 7th, 8th and 9th I didn't read my book at all which I am a bit miffed about but that's how it has been. Today is the 10th and I read one chapter and have now completed 10 out of 54. The fact that I'm not going to ride this weekend means that I could catch up a bit. Let's see.</p>
<p>I didn't read as much as I had planned to read but at the same time I did read a lot more than I have been reading in previous months. It's the 12th and I am more than 30% through the book which puts me roughly on schedule to complete it by the end of the month. However the goal was to complete by the 15th. That's in 3 days so is not going to happen.</p>
<p>This idea of reading 2 books this month was totally unrealistic. I knew that when I set the goal but then decided to go ahead with it anyway. I had calculated that it would take around 10 hours to complete a book but this book has 54 chapters and each one takes me 45 minutes to an hour: that means around 54 hours in total, which for a 30 day month is 1.8 hours a day. Let's just call it 2 hours a day, which is possible if I didn't watch TV series every day but I'm not quite able to suddenly wean myself off them just like that. There are days when I don't read at all which means that on the other days I would have to read a lot more. On this day, the 18th of September I am about 35% through and if I carry on at this rate I may actually finish by the end of the month but somehow I doubt even that.</p>
<p>This was meant to be the main goal this month or at least the one that would be taking up the most time. Since my last update on the 18th I didn't read at all. I mean perhaps part of a chapter but nothing like the progress I was making at the start of the month. It had become totally sidelined in favour of watching TV series: the antithesis of my goal. I knew before I started that it would be a very tall order but didn't realise that I would have such a strong reaction to it. The ideal and the real are indeed worlds apart.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
<p>Get my mentee ready for their solo shift, commitment & SIT2 training. Come up with a fund-raising strategy for the branch in readiness for the financial status of the branch changing on the 1st of October.</p>
<p>As they haven't been able to take calls themselves yet due to the delay in receiving their DBS we did a lengthy skills practice where I pretended to be a caller.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 7th my mentee took her first call. She did really well and I feel very proud. It's a big step going from the classroom to actually taking a real call. She said that she felt very comfortable about it which gave me confidence that I hadn't pushed her into it too early but then I couldn't have done that as the DBS hadn't been approved anyway. Even though I've been enjoying being a mentor it was nice to also to do a duty on my own.</p>
<p>I've got a couple of meetings set up with professional fundraisers later in the month which should give me some good ideas to create a fundraising strategy.</p>
<p>Here is one thing that has gone well over the past few days. I've been getting on really well with my mentee and do find that it is a good match. It has been a real privilege to watch her transformation and during the past few days it was getting her ready for her solo duty next week.</p>
<p>The solo duty went well and in the follow up to that one I was perhaps a little too stand off ish in my manner but feel that I have done my duty in being a mentor in preparing my mentee for duty. It has been a busy month which I have enjoyed very much but am now looking forward to answering calls myself but will be having one more session with my mentee before their commitment day.</p>
<li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
<p>Build a Hackintosh laptop for my housemate.</p>
<p>He has intimated that if a desktop would be an easier job for me then he would be happy with that. I know of one that I could use and at a very good price.</p>
<p>I seem to have found a 19in monitor too which means only graphics card, memory and SSD to acquire.</p>
<p>The desktop has arrived and it works ok. The screen is on its way so it's time to make sure that I have the other parts too.</p>
<p>Here is another goal that worked out rather well. Build a low cost but high performance computer. Once I had all of the parts it only took me one afternoon refreshing myself of the instructions and then a morning taking my housemate through what I had done and then setting it up in his room. There was one issue which I took rather lightly and that was the case of a black screen following the Apple logo leading up to the login screen. It also happened on my own computer so it meant that it was necessary to fix on my own machine too. I slept on it after reading a few articles and woke up with a solution. It took a little more research but soon had a solution that worked in both cases. Ticked and punched the air. A very satisfactory conclusion to the month.</p>
