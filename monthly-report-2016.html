<p>We start on the 8th of July for the 2nd half of the year. Seems to have gone well in the first half of the year and of course in the latter half I would like to improve upon it. Having said that everything has been going well, the programming and clutter clearing hasn't gone as well as I was hoping.</p>

<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>This goal really seems to have taken centre stage and I really can feel myself getting stronger. The training habit is very much in place and I have just started a new routine this month. Already after a week of following it I can feel that I have made progress so I'm going to need to adjust some of the exercises but other than that the goal is to follow it on the designated days. There is more work on the rings and more static holds. The handstand is now part of the routine which is working better because having it as part of the yoga session meant that it was a bit hit or miss. I've been thinking about joining some sort of online strength training group or program such as the Gold Medal Bodies one. The main reason would be to follow a program that was laid out by experts and also to get support. It's also not overly expensive. But I'm quite happy with my current program so I think I will follow that for the month at least: better not to keep changing things too much.</p>
