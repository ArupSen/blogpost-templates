<p>The start of a brand new month and this month as the physical goals are progressing so well my aim is to allow them to continue rolling along while I focus a little more effort toward programming and reading.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>On this the very first day of the month as I did last month I began by riding 100km or 107km to be exact. This wasn't an actual audax ride but a route that I have taken from bigfoot.cc and edited slightly taking in the Kent Downs and the Surrey Hills. So far this year I've been riding mainly my fixed gear bike but today was on my geared bike especially as there were some tough climbs. I would say that there were five in all but they all seemed a bit easier than the last time I rode this route as I've been riding long distances on fixed consistently this year. There were also some strong headwinds but the weather was gorgeous. I left the house at 0700 and was home at 1200 which is pretty fast for a slowcoach like me. I made two short 10 minutes stops and was pushing quite hard most of the way rather than taking it easy. I certainly have became a whole lot stronger and fitter. All these extra rides in addition to the actual audax rides are both to maintain my general level but also to get myself ready for that first 300 in April.</p>

<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I really must finish Moby Dick during the first few days of March and get started on a new book. This really is taking way too long.</p>
<p>In both January and February this year I did manage to dedicate a day to the reading day but found that I got distracted incessantly. Today (2nd) I thought about what a "day" actually meant. I realised that I haven't defined it clearly. When I think of a reading day I sort of imagine myself reading for the whole day without doing much else. But there are other regular tasks during that day such as perhaps strength training or yoga: the reading day has to work around these regular fixtures. If this is the case then what would I consider to be a successful "day" be it reading or programming? As I've been logging my hours this year it falls upon the number of hours accrued on the day. As a realistic target I'm going to assign six hours i.e. greater than or equal to six hours of actual reading whether at home or preferably at a cafe or library being the mark of a successful "day". With a little planning the day before I think this is well within my means and still leaves ample time to carry out the regular fixtures.</p>
