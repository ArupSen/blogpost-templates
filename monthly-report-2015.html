<p>Day one, the first of Jan. A blank file set up and ready for filling with some good reports.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>The first and probably the only opportunity to ride a 200km audax this month will be the one on the 17th called the Willy Warmer. I'm planning to get myself on that one and have started training. Today, the 2nd, a Friday, I did a non-stop 40 mile / 60 km ride down in Kent. It's one that I've ridden before and comes from the bigfoot.cc website. Country lanes with some rolling hills. What I'll need to do is to ride this route again but at night with my new dynamo lights which are yet to arrive. The sun sets around 4.00pm at the moment and I think that I will probably have this distance left to ride after that. The other thing that I need to do is to work on getting up early as the ride starts at 08:00 and I've been getting up well after that.</p>

<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>

<li><h4>Typing</h4>

<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I started reading Moby Dick in December 2014 and am continuing with that through January of 2015. I've also set a date for the reading day - it coincides with a fasting day.</p>
