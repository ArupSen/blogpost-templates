<p>The Dunwich Dynamo ride which goes from Hackney in East London to the East coast of Suffolk is a ride that I've heard about for many years but have never ridden. A night ride starting at around 9.00pm although there is no official start time. I had heard of it through the members of the <a href="http://lfgss.com">lfgss.com</a> forum and from wheel clients. The route is just under 200km and fairly flat. Very fixed gear friendly.</p>
<p>Now that I'm into my third season of Audax riding I thought I would use this as a training ride and also ride back to make it an unofficial 400km. Having 350km in total in the previous Audax I thought that 400 would be within my reach. My lodger wanted to do it and Brad wanted to do it so rather than look for an Audax or ride a DIY I thought that I might as well. Brad sent me the .gpx files for the routes out and back which I edited very slightly and copied into my Garmin.</p>
<p>Other than that I didn't do any preparation. I would be using the same bike as I had ridden for an Audax a couple of weeks previously so taking a nap in the afternoon and putting a few bits in the saddle bag was all that was required. In terms of food I packed a toasted peanut butter and jam sandwich along with a couple of Snickers bars.</p>
<p>After my nap I ate a large bowl of pasta as soon as I got up. I left the house at 19:30 along with my lodger and it was the first time that we had ridden together. He rides track and also races so it wasn't easy to keep up with him but he did wait for me. We parted company at Elephant &amp; Castle where he went via Southwark Bridge and I to Tower Bridge to meet with Brad and Omar. We chatted for a few minutes before setting off to London Fields. We noticed other riders heading in the same direction.</p>
<p>It wasn't long before we set off. The roads were very crowded and we rode along the Lee Bridge Road until we reached the Epping Road, one of my pet hates. This section was very crowded indeed. Cars and riders jostled for position and the whole train moved at such a tardy rate I asked myself it would be a better idea to turn around and go home. But I hoped that it would improve further along the route and it was indeed a fine night weather wise. I would also loose an opportunity to ride a 400 and I was on fairly good form fitness wise. It was just a case of getting my mood right.</p>
<p>I noticed that at the first garage on the Epping Road that some riders had stopped. It wasn't even an hour from the start and they had made their first stop. Very odd in my view. My two fellow riders agreed. The slow and crowded traffic continued all the way to a point where the main roads changed to more country lanes. At this point it all thinned out and the pace picked up a bit. I really wanted to make up for lost time and push the pace but the others seem happy to ride marginally faster than we had been going before. We noticed that many more groups had stopped along the road and wondered when it would be good for us to take a short break. Most of the pubs seemed way too crowded and we could guarantee there would be queueing.</p>
<p>As the lanes grew darker we could see riders with multi-coloured lights and their whole bike lit up like a Christmas tree. The lights were fun to see. However there were others with music blaring and I didn't find this at all entertaining. We had got ourselves away from the noise and the bustle of the city but some had brought it with them. This was not welcome at all.</p>
<p>Before our first proper stop we noticed a pile up on the side of the road. Most were riding past but we stopped to offer assistance. A rider had taken a fall due to a pothole but then another rider immediately behind them hadn't managed to brake in time and had hit them and thus fallen even harder. The first had cuts and bruises but the second had what appeared to be a dislocated shoulder and there staring into space, clearly suffering from shock. Brad offered him some Ibuprofen which he gladly accepted. The accident site was next to a house and the residents soon arrived home. After we knew an ambulance was on its way and that some would stay with the injured we got on our way again.</p>
<p>Our first proper stop was the Fox Inn in Finchingfield. It was a large pub and a large crowd had gathered there. In spite of this no queueing was required to get water and snacks. There was a band playing inside and sausages grilling on a barbecue outside. Many groups whizzed past as we ate our snacks and many took their time drinking beers and enjoying their food. As usual I didn't want to stop for too long.</p>
<p>After our stop I was still very annoyed about the crowded road and the overall pace of the ride. I'm not implying that I am in any way a fast rider but it was too slow for me. I grew so frustrated that before I had had a chance to tell my riding partners what I was about to do I took off. I really didn't care whether the other two had followed me or not, I just wanted to get past the traffic and ride at a pace that suited me. After about half an hour of this Omar caught up with me. He said that my rear light had a very distinctive shape and position and was very easy to track in the dark. However, that meant Brad was behind. He was purposely riding at a cautious pace so that he would have ample energy for the return leg.</p>
<p>After another short stop Omar took off but this time I decided to stay with Brad. We saw a bacon roll stand in a lay-by with only a small crowd. We stopped to eat and stocked up on more Snickers bars: my chocolate of the ride. Soon after this the sun came up and a couple of hours later we were at the finish. It was a beach on the other side of Dunwich Nature Reserve. Some breathtaking heathland with heather and a sense of untouched wilderness. This view coupled with the sun rising made a combination to die for and I put aside my regrets about coming on the ride.</p>
<p>We were greeted by a very busy beach café and Omar of course. It was 06:15 which meant that it had taken around 9 hours. I would be happy with this time in terms of an Audax 200 so in spite of my complaints about the pace being slow the overall ride time was pretty good. While Brad and Omar queued for food I caught up with my lodger Atiba. He had started a bit earlier to avoid the crowds (a very wise choice) and had stopped only once. The fire station selling burgers wasn't crowded when he had passed. He had waited there to digest properly but for the rest of the ride had consumed energy bars and gels. He finished at 04:00 which is 7 and a half hours but since then had been waiting around. Brad had kindly bought some food for me and asked us to join them inside the café. A very welcome Cornish pastie. Followed by a Snickers of course. There were toilets here too and I took the opportunity while it presented itself. On longer rides, especially night rides at some stage an evacuation of the bowels in required. As a person who is very regular and goes generally once a day I find that on 100km and 200km rides it is never an issue but something to think about on longer ones. On this occasion the timing couldn't have been better.</p>
<p>After our break at around 07:00 we set off for the return part of our journey. Very few would be undertaking this distance and most were either returning by coach (a service run by Southwark Cyclists where the bikes are carried in a furniture lorry) and some by train. Having to ride no further they had adjourned to the beach. We saw the beach from a close distance but didn't set foot upon it.</p>
<p>Less than an hour on the way back we noticed riders gathered outside a convenience store (still riding the outward leg) and decided to stock up on food supplies. We didn't stop for long. We filled our bottles and took some snacks. This time I took the lead but went off ahead. Later on when they had caught up with me Omar said, "You ate a packet of crisps and then took off!" I returned, "The power of Prawn Cocktail."</p>
<p>Next stop was Needham Market where we found a co-op supermarket and I recognised it as one of the controls from the Green &amp; Yellow Fields ride from April. Within minutes of us stocking up with food supplies the sky turned dark and heavy rain began to pour. We rode through it for an hour and a half and there was no sign of it lessening. We noticed a McDonald's and decided to stop, dry off and eat. A burger and fries never went down so quickly. We noticed a couple of other riders had stopped there for the same reason and very soon a group of Elliptigo riders arrived and joined us. It's rare that I eat at a McDonald's but on this particular occasion it was very welcome. By the time we got on our way again the rain was but a drizzle.</p>
<p>We were all shivering with cold but soon the sun was out again to warm us and dry us off. We were enjoying ourselves again but very soon we were lost. The route took us down a single track road and then into a field. It was muddy and the mud got onto our shoes and tyres. The gps was pointing us through the field. We tried this way but came up to a fence and thick bushes. We turned back and retraced our route. It was an hour and a half's detour to trudge across the field and back followed by time cleaning our bikes. It didn't take long to find an alternative way around and get back on track. Rather irksome but I was also surprised that we all kept our heads: we didn't argue or blame.</p>
<p>It was still sunny and we were tired but in good spirits and continued our journey along pretty country lanes towards Epping and finally London. Our final stop was at a village called Good Easter. We ate our remaining snacks and filled up on liquids. It was a quaint little café and post office. Just the place for a quiet Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>Around 50km to ride till London and now we faced a section of rolling hills. The outward journey had been very flat and even though this section of hills wasn't particularly steep they did feel hard after being depleted with 350km in our legs. I asked about one more stop but Omar was keen to get home and suggested we go for it without any further stops. I was doubting whether I should have ridden fixed gear. Omar took off in front and we struggled to keep pace. Brad got a puncture so we stopped and Omar being so far in front and also so close to home probably thought it best to continue alone.</p>
<p>The dreaded Epping Forest road again. Cars crawling due to a collision and police vehicles blocking the way. Walthamstow, Hackney and then Elephant &amp; Castle where we parted company. I got home just after 20:00. Atiba was already home so we exchanged tales of our travels home. 400km on fixed gear done. The furthest that I have ridden in one ride.</p>
