<p>It's the 8th of December and I have only just published the monthly report for November so I am feeling a bit behind with things. As I mentioned in that report, one of the things that has delayed many projects is entertainment. As I mentioned in the November report it has been quite guilt free but it still draws time and energy away from other things. Hopefully, I can get the balance right this month.</p>
<p>A very late start indeed on the 15th of December and I haven't set any goals for this month and I'm getting a bit anxious about the plan for next year. I really want to have that ready so that I can hit the ground running but then I do have a fairly good idea of what I want to do and it is much the same as this year. Moving from November to December has been pretty smooth. Knowing that most of the goals are ongoing and that the plan will be much the same next year allows me to think of it more as a long 24 month year rather than a 12 month one: a year is only an arbitrary division of time anyway.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>I'm very happy with the way this is going so far this month. I've seen good progress on all of the exercises and my stability on the rings has really improved. I thought it would take a lot longer but in just a few short weeks I've moved forward much further than I thought I would. The only changes that I've made this month are use the final sets of my five supersets to work on what I have planned for next year: the muscle-up and the lever. I did experience some minor shoulder pain doing dips on the rings but using strict form I seem to have remedied this. It was a little bit worrying as it could have really broken the flow but I'm being very careful.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p>One of the ways I've suggested to Maya as a means of eating more healthily is have one day a week as a NO SUGAR day. I think that I need to adopt this strategy myself. But which day? Mondays and Fridays are fasting days so they are already sugar free days. Could it be a weekend? I think, at least as far as I can see at the moment, that I cannot designate a regular day so perhaps it'll have to be one that is set from week to week. That means that there is more chance of it being missed but that is how it'll have to be for now.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>I've been enjoying some distraction free yoga i.e. without looking at a screen and I must say it has been quite refreshing. It does raise the importance of my practice rather than it being a stretch session while I watch TV, which obviously makes it clear that the TV is more important than the yoga. One thing I started to notice is that if I watched something short and I then moved my attention away from the screen back to the practice I noticed a sense of focus and engagement and a certain depth that can only be experienced when one is fully focused. The practice itself is still fairly random but at least I'm staying in postures for longer, being sensitive and breathing properly.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p>After a short period of being quite systematic with this I seem to have missed a week but it still feels good to have moved a couple of larger items.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>On the 2nd of December I rode to Much Hadham. It was the first non-commuting ride that I had ridden since the Audax ride on the 1st of November. I had also planned to ride back as it's only 60km but then felt lazy after our meal and got a lift home. It was however a continuous ride of around 3 hours and I seemed have maintained my fitness level even though I hadn't been riding much. This ride was pretty straight forward and it turned out be a nice day for December.</p>
<p>On the 5th of December I rode the South of Bucks Winter Warmer Audax from Beaconsfield. I have written a separate post about this ride but it was more of mental than a physical challenge. But I have now completed my RRtY challenge. On the one hand it does feel like a big achievement and on the other hand I feel relieved that it's over. Part of me wants to do it all over again and even try a double RRtY as one can ride them in parallel as long as you only count one ride once. I really should do another ride in December but I also want to take a break from it all too.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p>I really seem to have lost interest in programming so far this month but started to look at a course on Code School after some encouragement and prompting from someone at Code School. It feels somehow half hearted and I really don't want to force it if I really don't feel like it and turn it into a chore. So I don't think I'll set myself a goal for this one this month.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>Having set a goal of doing this 2-3 times a week rather than every day I seem to be encouraged to do it again and quite enjoying it too.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>Really have no interest other than a fading memory of books that I enjoyed earlier this year. I did choose a book whose name I can't even remember that is a great start and after dipping back into Don Quixote and not finding it very engaging I seem to have given up again. I think it's going to have to be a trashy novel or nothing.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Entertainment</h4>
<p>My month of Netflix binge watching ended on the 12th of December. I did enjoy it but didn't feel that it was worth the regular payments when they didn't offer content that I wanted and their content also had a life span. I've gone back to 'free' streaming sites and even though the image quality is less than HD it doesn't detract from the enjoyment it provides.</p>
<p>The other form of entertainment that I've been enjoying again is gaming. I bought a few games in the summer but after a month or so stopped playing them. After a recommendation from one of my Samaritan colleagues I purchased a title and have been playing again. I thought about taking my gaming experience a stage further and I've written a post about it this month asking if I should build a gaming PC.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
<p>Met up with those that were in my training group for an early xmas get together. It was great to see them again and feel how far we had all come. At the start there were 14 of us and many had been lost along the way. There were only 5 of us at the meal. I have put myself forward to cover a couple of shifts for xmas eve and boxing day mainly due to people being away. I'm quite looking forward to it as I'm not planning to celebrate as such this year so I guess I'll be taking calls from those that did want to celebrate or spend time with loved ones but couldn't.</p>
