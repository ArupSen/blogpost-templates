<p>It's the 3rd of January and I'm punctually starting the new year. I've written up a review of 2015, set goals for 2016, written a monthly report for December 2015 so I feel up to date and extremely well connected with my goals and blogging about them. The plan this year is to look at the list for the year and then set a smaller goal for the month which takes a step towards the goal of the year. The effect of this means that not only am I reading the goals for the year at the end of the month prior to the review but I am also looking at it at the start of the month to decide what I'll be working on that month. I have a good feeling about 2016: I feel more confident because I know what I want, what I'm capable of and made plenty of room for faffage.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>The workout for this month is already set which is essentially a continuation from the final weeks of December where I switched from doing supersets to straight sets. Today (3rd January) I have set out the actual workout which I did on Friday 1st January. It's already on my workout repo on GitHub so I'm ready for this one.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Diet</h4>
<p>The goal for this month is to find one meal that I would like to eat on a regular basis which could also be made into a frozen meal. Some previous ideas have been chicken and sweet potato as well as tuna and sweet pototo fish cakes. But it doesn't have to be these. As well as coming up with an idea see if you like it and try freezing portions.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Yoga practice</h4>
<p>Make the free-form aspect of the practice truly free-form in that there is no prescription and no particular list of requirements other than to get on the mat and do some yoga. As for the handstand find a suitable progression and assess which stage of said progression would be the right place to start.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing Clutter</h4>
<p>Have a look through the db and update it as required. Put handlebars on eBay and Martina's laptop. Get an idea of how long it would take to discard all items that are not borderline.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>Book on the Willy Warmer ride. Set a date for doing a perm. Set a date for a ride with Luke or Junior. Set a training ride date. Set days for roller sessions. Intervals on Thursday.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming</h4>
<p>Choose a course for January from Code School and set sessions for the week. The sessions don't need to be long. They could be an 1 hour 3-4 times a week along with some Code Eval and YouTube follow ups.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>It would be better if the 2-3 times per week were always the same days but that isn't always possible. I'm thinking Tuesday and Thursday as I don't workout on those days so there are fewer items on the list.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>The list for the year has already been made and I have already made a start on the Pickwick Papers so it's just a case of reading a chapter or two of the book each day.</p>
<li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
<p></p>
<li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
<p>Although my one-off goals so far are to find a job and work on my web service, I think that for January the most urgent goal would be to start, complete and submit my self-assessment tax return. It doesn't take long and I leave it till the last minute each year and it looks as though this year in spite of saying that I wouldn't I have done the same again.</p>
