<p>Day one, the first of Jan. A blank file set up and ready for filling with some good reports.</p>
<p>Now at day 12 I've had my first dip following the initial enthusiasm at the start of the year. But then I had been flying high so flying at an average height did feel somewhat low. It was my first full weekend with Maya this year and one of my aims was to prevent her from watching too much, be it Disney movies or YouTube. I did manage to do this but it did involve doing more things together. That was a good thing but it showed me that I have been allowing her to watch a lot of videos while I get on with things that I need to do. It has meant that I haven't really been spending as much quality time with her as I could given that I only see her every other weekend. If she was living with me full time then giving her a chance to watch movies while I get on with something else makes sense but that is not the case. I don't see her day to day and the time that we spend together is very concentrated, which means that the more that we can actively do together the better. This weekend we went to a party, did a few errands and went swimming. The other change is that I have been training myself to get up earlier due to the ride coming up next weekend. Following xmas I was rising at around 0830 and to suddenly rise at 0500 is too much of a shock to the system. Leading up to the weekend I rose at 0700 for two days and then at 0600 over the weekend. Today I rose at just after 0600 unassisted by the alarm clock. When Maya is staying with me what usually happens is that I put her to bed, often a little later than her usual bedtime because it's the weekend and because I tend to go to bed a bit later. But when I read the story (which often I'm reluctant to do) I tend to nod off and then feel groggy when I finally leave the room. I do a few things for a couple of hours and then return to bed at my usual time of 0130 only to be woken by Maya at 0730 feeling that I need more sleep. The solution was to both go to bed at the same time which was about 3 hours earlier for me and around an hour later for Maya. She was a lot keener about going to bed knowing that I was going to bed too. In the longer term i.e. for the rest of the year as I'm planning to do a lot more rides being used to getting up early will work in my favour for both offcial rides and training rides. Obviously in the summer it will be a lot easier but so far the change to my personal time zone doesn't feel like a big shift.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>Missed a session on Wednesday (7th) due to doing a long cycle ride but managed to increase my rep count on all exercises today (9th) so I'm very happy with that.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>I've jotted a few notes about what to work on during the first month. Mainly some backbends which is one of the group of postures that I tend to neglect in my classes and also in my own practice. So far it's been a case of swapping out certain postures for other ones.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>The first and probably the only opportunity to ride a 200km audax this month will be the one on the 17th called the Willy Warmer. I'm planning to get myself on that one and have started training. Today, the 2nd, a Friday, I did a non-stop 40 mile / 60 km ride down in Kent. It's one that I've ridden before and comes from the bigfoot.cc website. Country lanes with some rolling hills. What I'll need to do is to ride this route again but at night with my new dynamo lights which are yet to arrive. The sun sets around 4.00pm at the moment and I think that I will probably have this distance left to ride after that. The other thing that I need to do is to work on getting up early as the ride starts at 08:00 and I've been getting up well after that.</p>
<p>More training today on the 7th with a 100km ride into Kent and Surrey. There were some very tough long climbs and some sections with headwinds. My toes were frozen in spite of two pairs of socks and even tin foil. I had overshoes too. The rest of me was fairly warm, especially on those climbs. Didn't take many stops as it was too cold but felt fairly comfortable at the end. Left the house at just before 10.00 and was home a little after 3.00. Could I do two of those back to back? Probably. But I'll need to do some of it in the dark so I still need to do the dynamo training. I've now built up a dynamo wheel and my lights have arrived too so possibly Sunday evening. Exciting.</p>

<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>

</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I started reading Moby Dick in December 2014 and am continuing with that through January of 2015. I've also set a date for the reading day - it coincides with a fasting day.</p>
