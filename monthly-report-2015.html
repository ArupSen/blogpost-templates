<p>The end of one month seems to have blurred into the beginning of the next. On the one hand I'm busy but on the other hand I'm trying not to be busy. It's the 7th already as I start this months report which also heralds the 2nd half of the year and also 5 years since I moved into this flat in Sydenham. But when you think about it, these are all arbitrary markers of time. Days are still made up of mornings, afternoons and evenings and that fact will never change.</p>

<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>Rode my first unofficial 400km along with two fellow audax riders. It was the Dunwich Dynamo ride which I've been wanting to ride for a while. We rode there and back. I've written more fully about in a dedicated post rather than make this one too cluttered.</p>

<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>

<li><h4>Typing</h4>

<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I seemed to be finding renewed vigour again last month but towards the end of the month and into the beginning of this month it has all but dwindled away. I was enjoying the book, Don Quixote, but seem to be using my spare time gaming and watching "Lost Girl" when I do have the opportunity to read. It's not a difficult book at all but perhaps I need to choose something even more low brow such as one of the Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child so that at least I'm in the swing of reading again.</p>
