<p>It's April and the sun has finally come out. It has been nice to finally get out in the garden again after what feels like a very long winter. After a good amount of leisure last month I feel that I want to pursue my goals more fully again this month but obviously without any pressure.</p>
<p>At just past the halfway point on the 18th I feel that I have been through a process of feeling that I was getting behind to feeling that I'm getting on top again. The main thing is that the king has taken his place on the throne once more: I'm riding Audax again after a two month break. Of all of my goals, last year this one was the one that took centre stage and removing it for a short period gave me sense that I didn't really know what I was doing.But having ridden an Audax on the 9th of the month and also enjoyed it very much I feel that I have my focus back again. But this time it feels different: there is a lot less pressure to get on and complete rides with a greater emphasis on enjoyment which is permeating into my other goals.</p>
<p>I've had a lot of builds to build too this month, more than I had expected. It's a good thing I guess as it shows that even though I increased my prices I am still generating orders and I am making money to cover my costs. But it does take time and I have been catching up from last months orders too.</p>
<p>That's it for another month and I think I did rather well. Some goals simply held out while others slowed down to a crawl. Good to see cycling back up there. It's not a goal but I've been playing the guitar again now that I have hung it on the wall. Towards the end of the month I was thinking a lot about my goals even though I wasn't reading the year plan or writing in this report but the fact that I was thinking about them shows that they are indeed important to me: writing about them in my morning pages and thinking about them as I fall asleep at night. It just shows that I have tapped into what I really care about rather than doing what I ought to be doing.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>The main for this month is consistency and consolidation. I don't really want to move forward as such on to the next exercise. At the moment I am nearing the 3 sets of 8 reps for each of the exercises that I'm doing but the form is not super strict and could do with some improvement which is really what I want to work on this month. Just get each rep smooth and get a sense that I feel very comfortable and could almost do it easily.</p>
<p>I've had days when I have been totally exhausted or busy or just not very motivated but even then have managed to do something in the way of training be it a cut down version or dropping the exercises to the previous level. The force is strong with this one.</p>
<p>Don't think I've gained any strength this month but it has been very much a maintenance month. There were days when I missed it and days when I just was not in the mood but on it goes.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Diet</h4>
<p>Last month I experimented with eating more protein and I think it helped with my strength training but it also helped me to create a structure around which to hang my meals and it proved to be generally healthier: I cooked, I planned ahead, I ate a lot more veg and I ate a lot less junk food. So the plan this month is to simply continue with that and see how it goes. I can't really think of how I would improve this regime and it has been the most effective one both in terms of motivation and ease of application.</p>
<p>I seem to have lost touch with the protein regime and overloaded on carbs. I sort of enjoyed this but am also concerned that if I neglect my protein strategy for too long I will lose a method of bringing the whole of my diet together. My plan then is to stick with it as far as possible which means that sometimes it is not possible due to circumstances or just unwillingness but I do have a sense that this strategy could work out long term.</p>
<p>In the final week of the month the protein intake sort of came back again but so did the love of junk food. It's still early days but I do think that I'm on to a winner in spite of the lapses.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Yoga practice</h4>
<p>Even though doing an intuitive and organic session gets me on the mat I still think a little bit of structure would help. I have put some ideas on the table about having a structured session once a week or using a timer but it's rare that I do it. I also haven't been working on the hand stand much which was meant to be my goal for the year: that is something I need to bring back into the sessions just to see if I am still into the idea and perhaps use a timer in one session.</p>
<p>There still seems to be a lack of structure or a structure that I want. What I have is the freeform session while watching something. This has been a good start and it does keep me doing it but now that I am doing it on a regular basis I want to progress as well as maintain. I am of the belief that if I push too hard by creating too much pressure to progress then I will lose the momentum entirely and simply skip my sessions: is this true? I need to test it to find out.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing Clutter</h4>
<p>Not sure what to assign myself this month as I didn't really get very far last month.</p>
<p>When I see the clear clutter reminder which still goes off on a Friday morning I ask myself what I'm doing about it and how I will further myself in this goal but as I have no clear plan I only think about it but take no action. I'm disappointed that I do nothing but at the same time I'm also happy that I am reminded of it because it is something that continues to concern me.</p>
<p>I took some clothes to the charity shop, gave away a guitar stand and put an old watch on ebay. Not a great deal you may say but a good amount above zero. It has given me some ideas about how to proceed with this goal in the coming months.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>This month I have 2 Audax rides planned and one booked so I need to get out and train but having had 2 months off I am not very motivated. Again I don't really want to push myself as it's meant to be fun rather than fulfilling quotas. The first one is a very hilly 200km ride so if I enjoy that one then it will show that I'm still into it.</p>
<p>Managed to get out for a ride today, the 6th, in preparation for the hilly ride on Saturday the 9th. It was a 100km ride into Kent / Surrey mainly to test my fitness both physical and mental. Having not ridden any long rides for around 2 months I am concerned about how well my body performs on the bike and also having quit a ride that I had booked last month I wondered also if I had gone off the idea altogether. I can safely say that my physical fitness hasn't gone down too much as there were 2-3 long challenging climbs and along with that it was very wet and windy. I got thoroughly soaked and then dried off and then got soaked again in a heavy downpour. I didn't really stop other than for a short 10 minute halfway break and ate only a handful of dates. I can feel sure about my fitness level then and rest assured that I'll be OK in that department. But what about enjoyment? I would say that I enjoyed it more than I had expected but not as much as I had hoped. What does that mean? Well, if you had asked me at any point during the ride if I was enjoying it then I had expected that around 40% of the time I would have replied in the affirmative but as it turned out the actual enjoyment level was more like 60% but I had hoped for something like 80%. At times I did experience some boredom and some flashbacks of riding perms when I didn't want to but on the whole it was great to get out and ride and it reminded me of how much I had missed it. I'm now looking forward to Saturday and hopefully the weather will be better than it was today.</p>
<p>Had a great ride on Saturday the 9th and enjoyed it very much. It was a hard ride but not as hard as I had expected. It has rekindled my enthusiasm for long distance riding and I have started on writing a separate ride report about it.</p>
<p>Following this ride I have been on a couple training rides: one down into Kent and one up to Much Hadham in preparation for my next Audax on the 23rd which will be Oasts and Coasts, a 300km ride from Meopham. I will be riding to the start making it a 370km ride.</p>
<p>The rides that I had planned leading up to the Audax didn't work out as planned but I did instead ride a number of shorter rides and this did indeed work out as a preparation for the long ride. The rides were only 2-3 hours but seemed ample as a training for what turned out to be a 373km ride. It was very cold and it followed routes that I had ridden before at least in the first half. The 2nd half took me to parts of Kent that I hadn't visited before.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming</h4>
<p>Having more or less neglected this last month my strategy this month is to assign 3 sessions each week a bit like with the strength training to see if that will work. One session of Code Eval; one of Code School and one following one of the Functional Programming books. The question is when to assign those sessions. I think I will need to do it at the start of each week and see how it goes and if I do actually feel like doing it at the appointed time.</p>
<p>Having gone back to the ES2015 course that I started I found that I had lost touch with what I was doing so I decided to start another one called jQuery: the Return Flight, a follow up to a course that I took more than a year ago. It seems rudimentary but covers techniques and concepts that I haven't really covered before. Hopefully I'll stick with it. Although I'm enjoying it the level of interest does seem to be rather low and I'm more than willing to skip it do other things such as gaming.</p>
<p>I didn't really get very far with that course nor did I complete any Code Eval challenges, so it's very much a fail on the programming front. I'm actually not too disappointed because I half expected it.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>More or less carry on with last month really: work on accuracy over speed.</p>
<p>Working on my accuracy seems to be paying off. Even though I lost speed initially and was down around 10 wpm, I am making fewer and fewer mistakes and slowly but surely my speed is creeping up.</p>
<p>I'm quite pleased with the progress here. At first it seemed that I was only maintaining my speed and accuracy but my speed having gone down having focused on accuracy it has started to creep up again. I did find that Type Scout stopped working properly on Google Chrome, my browser of choice, but seems to work fine on Firefox. I've also noticed that the back of my right hand seems to be cold at times and also numb and the section between the third and fourth fingers can be quite stiff. This obviously hampers dexterity and thus reduces speed and accuracy. What I'm doing is to put my hands in warm water first and then some basic hand stretches which really has helped. Being able to sit closer to the desk also helps a great deal.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I didn't manage to complete Nicholas Nickleby last month therefore the first thing is to finish that one and then obviously to start the next one in the series and hopefully complete it too.</p>
<p>On the 18th of April I am only 75% through the book that I was expecting to complete at the end of last month but what I have thought is that because I'm enjoying this series so much I think that I will continue into 2017. That takes the pressure off trying to complete the series this year but at the same time I'm hopeful that it won't make me lazy about it.</p>
<p>I finished the book on the 1st of May, which is not quite end of the month but pretty close but that still makes me a month behind in terms of my one book a month rule. Am I slow reader or are the books really long? A bit of both I guess. Some of the passages are also very rich and beautifully written so I take time to read and re-read certain passages just to allow the literary mastery wash over me. As I've said above I've extended this goal into 2017 so I can focus on quality rather than quantity.</p>
<li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
<p>As well as doing my normal listening duties I have been considering if I should like to get involved with some other activity such as mentoring, fundraising or caller support. It's not a requirement but at first the commitment of six shifts over an eight week period seemed to be a lot greater than it actually is and I feel as though I am not really contributing very much. I suppose I could take on more shifts but at the same time I don't want to burn myself out either. I'm probably too inexperienced to mentor a new trainee but it will go into the someday / maybe list. But I'll look into one of the other admin or management roles and see if anything takes my fancy.</p>
<p>Various internal politics which I had managed to avoid until now are beginning to affect me and thus my ability to perform well as a listening volunteer. With these issues buzzing around my head I am unable to fully focus on the task at hand which is to support the listener. Alongside this we are moving from paper records to digital ones and also a change in management.</p>
<p>The e-log as it's called was launched on the 26th of April but then due to technical difficulties we went back to keeping paper records. I'm almost at the end of my probationary period and it will be like having my 'L plates' removed.</p>
<li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
<p>Since the beginning of the year I have been thinking about my wheel building database idea for other wheel builders as a subscription service and the first step was to get proof of concept by asking potential clients to give me their views: still feeling shy about it I guess. I'm going to set it as a goal for this month again but as it has been 3 months since the start of the year when I initially set it I don't set my hopes too high.</p>
<p>The other one-off goal for the year was to find some sort of part-time job. When I usually think about this I assume that it will be technology related but it doesn't necessarily have to be. It has to be only half a day a week, working from home and with no annoying clients. When I mentioned this to a friend he suggested that I write articles and blog posts as he has read my blog posts and says that I can write. My goal then this month is to consider other similar ideas and see if it might be possible to pursue them.</p>
