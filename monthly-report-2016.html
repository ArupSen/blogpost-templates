<p>It's the 5th of February and I feel that I'm much further into the month than I really am. Not sure why that is, perhaps because many things have been carried over from the previous month and I'm also excited about doing all the things that I do.</p>
<p>It's the 8th of February and the start of week two. I feel that the month is now starting to 'run away' and I haven't got to grips with it yet perhaps because there are goals which have carried over from last month. That makes me feel disappointed.</p>
<p>But it's a sense of disappointment that I tend to feel on a regular basis and something that I have reported in the past: that I tend to focus more on what I failed to achieve rather than celebrate what I did achieve. I wrote about it in my Morning Pages today that in spite of doing well in my strength training and cycling I don't feel that I am doing so well with my other goals. While I was out running errands I reflected on as well allowed myself to feel the disappointment and gradually began to see its cause. My results are not in line with my expectations but then I don't really have a clear idea of what those expectations are or a realistic idea of what could be achieved in a given time frame. That clearly is the purpose of this report: to feed back to myself on both my successes and my failings and details thereof to give me an accurate and realistic survey of the intent of each goal, the feeling of the attempt to achieve it and the actual outcome. Instead of expectation on previous performance I only write about my hopes and fears but since I have been writing these reports for a good length time and very consistently that should afford me the capacity to be more clear and precise in my estimations.</p>
<p>It's the 15th and that makes this the halfway point in the month and I would say that I feel rather good about everything. I feel engaged with all of my goals in that I am progress and not only that but I've been thinking about them when I'm not actually doing them which shows how well I have been doing with them and that they have been good choices and a good fit.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>Continue with January workout as it seems to be progressing quite well.</p>
<p>Still very much enjoying this but feel that I need some space around me as many of the exercises are done in the doorway. That doesn't stop them being effective and it hasn't really bothered me in the past but I'm feeling a bit cramped.</p>
<p>During the last session I felt a little under par and rather than miss the session or cut it short what I did was to perform an exercise from the previous level in the progression. I only had to do this for a few of the exercises and found that during the session my strength returned. Today I felt similar when I started out but found that I improved in most of my rep counts and enjoyed myself very much indeed. There was no sense of feeling cramped or any other form of annoyance.</p>
<p>What I've been noticing is that quite often the workout with a feeling of low energy and that I perhaps I should cut it short or skip it because I should perhaps consider how I'm actually feeling rather than following my routine. But one day I was very tired after a late night but it turned out that not only was I full of energy when I started but even made progress. Not only in the sense of increasing my rep count but a feeling of control in the exercises and an improvement of form and strictness of style. This gives me a great deal of confidence and encouragement that what I'm doing is working.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Diet</h4>
<p>See if the 'Chicken Tuesday' idea can be developed into a batch meal with other components. Freeze a meal and then defrost that meal and eat it at some point preferably when you have those times of grazing and feeling lazy about cooking.</p>
<p>When I feel disappointed with my diet my expectation is that I should be able to change to a healthy diet overnight and expunge all forms of undesirable treats entirely. This of course is totally unrealistic and therefore I often swing to the opposite expectation which is that over the course of many weeks, months or even years I will gradually reach a happy balance between the two and that I should not rush this process. I did achieve the 5:2 way of eating more or less overnight so it's clear that I am able to achieve certain dietary goals quite rapidly so what I need to do here is to aim to make my expectations clearer; lay down exactly what I want to eat and what I want to avoid or at least put into a treat category rather like limiting sugar intake for a child.</p>
<p>I have been pleased with my strength training progress and increased the amount of protein that I eat as a consequence but other than the addition at breakfast on my non-fasting days I haven't taken an accurate or systematic approach. As I've mentioned before, I don't want to follow a full time bodybuilders diet which is far too strict for my lifestyle and if anything I am an endurance athlete which is in the opposite end of the spectrum; a marathon runner compared to the sprinter. In order to get a more accurate idea I read some short articles on calculating how much protein I would need to eat in order to increase size and how one would implement that amount into ones daily intake. My current bodyweight is around 60kg and as a rough guide I would need to consume 120g of protein each day. A medium sized egg contains 6g of protein which would mean 20 eggs per day if I were to obtain all of my protein from that particular source. As I am not designing a diet purely to build mass and I dont' want to be eating 6 meals a day or take protein shakes at appointed times I decided that 60g each day would be a good starting point which for easy calculation is 20g per meal and not an excessive amount. But how would this work in terms of actual food and meals? I add an extra egg to my current two scrambled eggs to make the protein count 18g or near enough to the 20g. For lunch I could have a tuna salad. This would also cover my goal of increasing the amount of vegetable content coming into my system. One can of tuna, the ones I buy are 112g of drained weight which is 27g of protein. That's lunch done and I can vary the vegetable content to keep a sense of variety. Then for dinner I have my chicken. The thing I found with the cottage cheese was that I wouldn't eat the whole thing in one meal and then it would spoil which would deter me from having it and even fresh it wasn't something that I wanted to eat repeatedly. I have however discovered mozzarella cheese which I think I can eat on a regular basis.</p>
<p>I tried this strategy over the weekend and found it to be agreeable but perhaps I'm simply riding on a high. But it seems that by following this protein strategy I have addressed all of my dietary goals in one fell sweep. My plan is to take it for a spin over the next 6 weeks i.e. the rest of February and then March and report back at the end of that period.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Yoga practice</h4>
<p>Create a routine and set one session per week as a session where a routine is followed rather than free form and with no distractions.</p>
<p>Still seems to be more of an organic stretching session and I'm still happy that I'm doing something but it's more about maintenance rather than progress. But how much progress do I want? What am I prepared to do in order to achieve that progress? Do I really care about progress?</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing Clutter</h4>
<p>Set aside a time to think about clutter clearing rather than defer the reminder. One pomodoro unit perhaps.</p>
<p>I took my time looking through the database that I've created listing all of the items that I have considered should be discarded. I even took a photo of one such item ready to put onto eBay but have yet to create an auction.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>Set dates to ride two perms: the Ditchling Devil and the Boat Trip. Arrange a day to ride to Much Hadham and ride the potential Artisan Audax.</p>
<p>Rode to Much Hadham and back on Wednesday 3rd of February. It was again with the friend with whom I rode to Meopham at the end of January. It was a dry and cold day with some sunshine but also a bit windy. The headwinds did make the riding hard and it was also tough on the return journey with extra luggage in my pannier: I had essentially commuted to collect spokes for a wheel build. I was very impressed with my friend Junior as it was the furthest that he had ever ridden. Not only did he ride at my pace but he wasn't too tired the following day. Amazing.</p>
<p>So far this month I haven't ridden any Audax rides. The plan, if I do with to complete a double RRtY this year is to ride two 'Perms' this month. I was proposing to ride during the night this weekend but it was far too wet and cold and it seems that the weather will remain so. I obviously don't have to complete this challenge and I haven't fully committed myself to it but I still have two weeks remaining. I seem to feel comfortable with the idea of abandoning it.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming</h4>
<p>Finish the Git course on Codecademy and then follow up with the courses on Code School.</p>
<p>Although I haven't been continuing with the Git course either on Codecademy or on Code School I have been studying functional programming again and have been working on the challenges on Code Eval. Even though these aren't the goals for the month they are on the list for the year so I'm quite pleased with that. A concept of functional programming called currying suddenly became clearer when I was watching a YouTube video that showed a demonstration of it. This got me more enthusiastic about it and thinking about all the resources that I have at my disposal and the Programming Languages course where I had skipped certain sections due to finding them far too challenging: essentially incomprehensible.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>Type Scout exercises on Thursday and Sunday evenings as a minimum requirement with any more as a bonus.</p>
<p>So far so good in that I have been doing the sessions on Thursday and Sunday evenings.</p>
<p>When I had the goal set for doing it every day I seemed to do it at best twice a month but now that I have set it for only two times per week I find it so easy and manageable that I also add an extra one and make sure that it gets done.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>Finish Pickwick Papers and make a start on (and hopefully complete) Oliver Twist.</p>
<p>On the 5th of February I'm still continuing with Pickwick Papers and there is a good amount remaining. I'm aware that this means I am making things harder for myself in terms of the next book and the overall goal of completing the entire works. I think that a reading day will be required at some stage. Seems to make sense now.</p>
<p>On the 8th of February I am now at 89% completion of the Pickwick Papers but also feel that I have only 21 days remaining to read Oliver Twist if I am to aim to complete one book per month. I have read the first two chapters from Oliver Twist already but as I know the story and have seen the film adaptation the reading I think would be rather cursory. I do feel somewhat disappointed that I didn't finish the book during January but again this is a conflict of expectation vs reality. The goal was to read 3% per day and then increase that amount to the appropriate figure when I missed a day or read less or more than the required amount. But I also expected to cover that 3% in half an hour and in reality it took me more than hour to read 3% of that book. What I'm not taking into account then is the length of the book i.e. the number of pages. I'm not a quick reader by any means and I also need to be in the correct frame of mind to be able to focus on a novel. Sometimes I find myself falling asleep when I sit down to read or if I am pre-occupied with other things I cannot draw my attention away from those subjects to those of the story. These factors haven't really been addressed or considered.</p>
<p>I have however been keeping track of new words in a Mongo DB database.</p>
<p>Halfway through the month and Pickwick Papers completed I am 23% of the way through Oliver Twist. The chapters seem a bit shorter which perhaps helps as well as being familiar with the story itself. One thing that I have missed for many years since reading on the Kindle is reading in the bath. It's something that I used to do a lot and even though I have considered the purchase of a waterproof case I seem to have put it off. After receiving a faulty one a while ago (there was a hole in it), I received a new one last week which allowed me to indulge in this long neglected pleasure.</p>
<li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
<p>My first duty of the month was an early morning one where I started by responding to SMS 'calls' and then had planned to move over to taking phone calls but then ended up continuing with SMS for the rest of the shift. I want to improve my skills on all types of 'calls': phone, SMS and emails and wonder if I should focus on just one during a shift or do some of each.</p>
<li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
<p>I believe in my idea of the wheel tracking web service but do other wheel builders? I need to ascertain this before I start work on it. This month do some customer research and see how much it is really wanted.</p>
