<p>Earlier this year in January 2015 I bought myself a set of Jetblack R1 rollers. I've had turbo training on my Someday / Maybe list for a few years and following some advice I opted for rollers rather than a turbo. What stopped me from doing this was that in the past, many years ago in 2001, I used to have a turbo trainer but it seldom got used after the initial enthusiasm wore off. It was also a royal pain to mount the bike onto it. With the rollers however you simply place your bike onto it and that means I can use both my geared road bike and also my fixed gear commuter bike. It's now the very beginning of June and I have only ridden on the rollers on a couple of occassions for about 5 minutes at a time. My lodger however has been making good use of my rollers and does a workout on them at least 3 times a week. Seeing him on there reminds me that it is something that I need to do. He suggested that I schedule a slot once a week for roller training but I wasn't sure if that would help me to overcome the initial learning curve required with rollers so what I've decided to do is have an intensive break in period of a month where the plan is to ride them every day so that I get used to them quickly both in terms of the skill required and in terms of creating the habit. I don't plan to ride them every day in the longer term but like my lodger around 3 times a week especially on days that I am not able to get out and ride on real roads.</p>
<p>Rollers help to build greater balance on the bike, stronger core muscles, greater concentration and a smoother pedalling technique, all of which would be very welcome.</p>
<p>What I want to do this month in terms of posting on the blog is to write a very short report, which could even be a one liner so that it doesn't deter me from posting by feeling that I need to write a lot and also put a link to it on twitter so that I can keep track of it. The 30 days won't necessarily be 30 consective days as there will be days when I won't be able to do it such as this coming Sunday 7th of June which is the Ditchling Devil audax ride.</p>
<p>As I've recently developed a new love of fountain pens I am writing my posts first by long hand on paper and then typing them. The general format is freeform but I'm going to include the date, the day number i.e. which day in the 30 days, the bike that I used and how long I rode for as these will be things that I'll want to know. I have three bikes: Racer Rosa geared, Racer Rosa fixed and Henry Gregson fixed.</p>
