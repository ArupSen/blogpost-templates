<p>Today was the first time that I got on the rollers while Maya was here which was one of the original reasons that I got them in the first place: in order to be able to ride while she was here. I also tried out using a tea towel around my head which I attached using a safety pin and it worked really well. Not a particularly good look but it stayed on and it performed its function of keeping the sweat out of my eyes. Another 15 minute session with higher speed spins at 10 mins and 5 mins but seemed to get a little bit faster today. I was very preoccupied with plans for the rest of the day and what I needed to get done but in spite of this I managed to remain steady and fairly motivated.</p>
