<p>So here we are at the end of the year. It's the 29th of December in that 'corridor' between Christmas and new year. I have been thinking a little about the year that has passed and how I have fared with my list of goals. Also on the importance of having a list of goals and how that has helped me to achieve them. Having looked through one or two reports during the year I have actually done rather well given that I only started to put effort into it after the six month mark.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Working out</h4>
<p>This month I've been taking it a little easier as I've been recovering from the back injury I had last month but I'm more or less back to my normal level. I can't believe how consistent I've been with it. I guess partly because the session is so short in that lasts only 15 minutes. I have been doing the session religiously three times a week and have been seeing gains i.e. increases in reps every 2-3 weeks. Earlier this year if you had told me that I would be able to do 10 pull ups I would have thought you were mad as they were all assisted ones when I began. But now doing 10 pull ups through a full range of motion using good form is simply part of my routine and I can even realistically consider the idea of setting the goal at 20. As with other goals that are going well I often think about increasing the number of sets or the number of exercises but then worry about breaking the routine altogether: don't want to ruin a good thing. Think I'm happy with that I've got at the moment.</p></li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p>The year started with the idea of gradually introducing wholefoods into my diet so that I would move towards one that comprised of 80% wholefoods. But even though it was all about improving nutrition as soon as I saw that my friend had lost lots of weight in the summer and that she was following a diet that I was intrigued about having watched the BBC television programme about it, I immediately jumped ship and began to follow it. It's been a great journey and I have satisfied both the part of me that wants to eat healthily and that part that wants to eat lots of junk food. I've lost more than 11kg in body weight which I'm assuming is mainly fat. But has my diet improved? I believe that I am healthier in that I have a better nutritional intake but I don't have any proof. In the documentary about fasting the presenter takes a blood test before the dietary experiment which I did not but afterwards the composition of his blood was indeed improved so I'm assuming that the same as happened to mine. I'm in the process of writing a dedicated post about the 5:2 diet and my experience of it so I won't go into any more detail here.</p></li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>Surprisingly this 'just happened' as opposed to it being difficult in previous years. Why it was difficult in previous years and why it became easy now I cannot explain. I could propose many theories such as the fact of many of my other goals going well and therefore the yoga just sort of rode the wave. Or that I'm teaching very little and so need to maintain a good amount of personal practice or my level will just simply decline. But other than that I am unable to offer much of an explanation as to why I succeeded with my daily yoga practice. It was though very much a case of maintenace rather than progress. I have very much kept up my level and am able to do the postures that I teach very easily but as to improving and taking on postures that I find difficult, that hasn't been on my agenda but it has been in the back of my mind. One thing that I have noticed is that I tend to combine my yoga session with something else. During this month and also during previous months I have been either watching or listening to something. It's been mainly programming lectures / tutorials or radio shows. Video is obviously very distracting as it requires visual attention. Even the radio shows can be somewhat distracting as they take attention away from the yoga to the subject of the show. But then if that is what it takes for me to get myself on the mat then so be it. Although, I don't like it. It seems that the video or radio show is more important than the yoga or that the yoga isn't important enough or exciting enough to have a slot dedicated entirely to itself. I've also started to get used to listening to a show while doing my practice such that when I don't have one running in the background it does feel a little quiet and empty. But this consumption of media not just during yoga but in general is bothering me and how it seems to be creeping in everywhere. I really do want to oust it from my life and I also want to make progress with my yoga practice rather than simply maintain what I have. But what if I cannot do my practice without the media? I'll have to gradually wean myself off or go cold turkey.</p></li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p>Seem to have gone in fits and starts with this one. Having a list for each room makes things easier to manage and even though I have discarded a great deal of items there still remains a great deal that is unused and unloved. Why do I not simply put it in the trash? With some items there is the possibility of a sale but what I've noticed is that some items are just too small to take up much space in themselves and therefore remain. Over the course of the year I think I have done rather well but not so well in December. It really is a good feeling to make a decision on an item has been stashed away for possible use on some future date but when that time comes I usually forget that it's there. Use it or lose it still applies. It's an ongoing process and thus requires regular review.</p></li>
<li><h4>Audax</h4>
<p>In 2014 I rode seven official audax rides as well as my first DIY and that was also a DIY by GPS. I should be proud really because it's by best year to date in my short audax career but for some reason I'm not, at least to the extent one would expect. I guess because my fitness and confidence has improved quite rapidly and I realise that I'm capable of a lot more than I had initially anticipated when I first embarked upon this journey. I am disappointed because I wanted to start the season earlier than I did but I incurred an injury and my geared bike wasn't ready. I also seemed to taper off at my peak in the summer which I also found a little strange. After a break of almost 4 months without a long ride between August and December I did the London to Brighton on the 21st of December with a couple of friends and it showed me that my fitness hasn't totally disappeared. The ride was a lot easier than I had expected and mainly a question of mental state rather than physical fitness or strength.</p></li>
<li><h4>Bike training</h4>
<p>Not much to say really except that this idea stayed on the page. It is indeed a good idea if it had been implemented then it would have improved my speed and strength but I guess having only seen the figures or the articles on paper and not actually proved them to myself, some part of me wasn't convinced enough to follow through. Or simply that greater speed and strength on the bike wasn't valuable enough for me to engage with this kind of training. It's the sort of training a racer or time trialist would undertake so it seems perhaps a little excessive for a hobbyist / audaxer. But then audax routes do contain hilly sections and there is a time limit. But even at my slowest I've never been out of time so the only training required is long rides.</p></li>
<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p>In February I got into Javascript and thought I would have a go at learning it properly. I started strong but soon got distracted. Aside from building websites I didn't do any programming study till late summer when I got back on the JS trail and learned to build client side apps with Angular JS. I spent about a month doing this and then stopped in October to work on a course that I had attempted a couple of times before on coursera.org called Programming Languages. It's a tough course and on my previous two attempts I just found it too hard but this time even though I still found it tough I managed to make it through to the end and even understood a lot of the concepts. Perhaps a fourth time is required. The lecturer presented Ruby in a way that I haven't experienced before and gave me a whole new perspective on it, so much so that I have been focusing on it exclusively during December since the course finished. It really has rekindled my love of programming and that perhaps I'm not a gifted or a natural programmer but I certainly do love it. I want to learn more mainly because I do enjoy it but I don't want to learn it in order to earn money. I may possibly earn more money as a result of being a better programmer but I just like it and thus want to spend more time on it.</p></li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>Having discovered a software that would keep me at it I have indeed done so. The software in question is called Type Scout which I have probably mentioned in previous reports. I kept to my original plan of doing something like 15 minutes a day but this past month as I have been partial to using the Pomodoro technique I extended the session to the standard 25 minute period. I have certainly improved my typing skills but perhaps not as much as I would have thought but practice includes both maintenance as well as progress. I have enjoyed it very much and certainly feel that the exercises and general discipline have been worthwhile. I would still like to improve further both in terms of accuracy and speed and now have a sense of how much time and effort that will require. My current speed and accuracy is quite sufficient for my needs but one always wants more.</p></li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>Just from glancing through some of the books in my 'Read in 2014' collection I can see more than I had expected. I have actually read six books this year which is half of my annual target. I'm quite surprised. Three Thomas Hardy novels and two by W. Somerset Maugham and the George Orwell classic, 1984.</p></li>
<li><h4>Staying in touch with friends</h4>
<p>Although the idea with this goal was to be quite systematic the end result was in fact quite organic which sort of defeats the points of having it set as a goal. The idea behind the goal was to contact a friend on the list each month by some means so that the contact is not missed but that didn't happen in any month. I do recall making a list at some point and then next to their name I put a date for when they were last contacted and how. Without checking I would assume that happened last year and the goal was simply carried over. This year due to the lack of response from some friends following any contact made by me I somehow feel that my efforts have been in vain. I don't think I want to drop the idea of systematic contact entirely but think I will drop it as a goal on the list of goals for next year. Perhaps just a regular monthly reminder in my phone.</p></li>
