<p>The start of a brand new month and this month as the physical goals are progressing so well my aim is to allow them to continue rolling along while I focus a little more effort toward programming and reading.</p>
<p>It's the 10th of the month and my physical goals are all moving along smoothly but I'm still a little concerned about my more intellectual ones. I did manage to finish my book and choose a new one but programming is certainly being neglected. It's the age old problem of having too much work. February was a bit quiet in terms of wheel build orders but this month things have really picked up and since it was quiet last month it's a bit of a shock. On the one hand it's great to be doing something that I love but I also got used to having extra time available. As well as the wheel builds I also have website orders to process both in terms of updates to existing site as well as new websites to build. The programming takes a back seat yet again. But I have set a programming day this month so let's see if I can actually follow through with that.</p>
<p>It's now halfway through the month on the 17th of the month. I'm still cruising along in terms of the physical goals and completed another 200km audax ride on the 15th but things aren't going well on the intellectual front. I'm quite worried. I think that if I manage to get things rolling by the end of the month then they will continue to roll into the next month as has been the case with the physical goals. Would be really nice to have the full set moving forward on all fronts.</p>
<p>The end of another month which brings me up to the end of the first quarter and I feel that I'm doing rather well. A little bit lacking on the programming and reading front but there are still nine months to go so lots of time to catch up. Very happy with my general performance and also confident that I can keep it up having a good idea of what I'm capable of achieving. I don't want to push myself too hard and have a reaction but I also don't want to take it too easy when I know that I can push harder. I think that the pace I'm going at right now is a good one for the set of goals that I'm working on and my current conditions and circumstances.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>Aside from one or two sessions missed on bike training days it's all been very consistent and inching forward at each session. I noticed that in the local park they have a set of exercise stations: it's been enjoyable to try them out when I've been there with Maya. Even she had a go but I think that they are too big for her.</p>
<p>Now that I have training rollers, I thought of the idea of using them as a warm-up for my strength training sessions. I did this for the first time on Friday(27th) and found it very beneficial. I rode on them for 10 minutes which is what I would have done on a stationary bike at the gym (and indeed it is something that I have done at the gym when I have conducted my workout there many years ago) then proceeded to begin my session. I attacked the exercises with a little more gusto than if I had started cold or after merely doing some basic limbering up as I usually do. It worked in a similar way to working out immediately after a short (or not so short) ride.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p>Five days of eating normally and 2 days of eating a minuscule amount which usually includes a good amount of veg and protein. However this isn't the case on the normal eating days and the tendency has been to overindulge on the junk food such as chocolate and crisps. The main focus with this diet so far (since I began in July 2014) has been a reduction in bodyweight and now a case of getting the body fat percentage down as low as possible to around the 10% mark. But this does somewhat neglect the general five-a-day strategy whereby the focus is to consume at least five portions of fruit or veg per day. There are days when I consume no vegetables whatsoever and take in whatever I feel like. I was assuming that this novelty aspect of overdosing on the junk food would have lost its appeal some time ago but it seems that I'm not tired of it yet. Perhaps I am beginning to tire of it now as I am concerned about it and am looking into a strategy of increasing my veg consumption without clamping down too hard on the overconsumption of junk food. I want to continue to allow myself to indulge but just make sure that a certain minimum amount of vegetable portions are part of that consumption. Whether that is five or less for the time being is something that requires some consideration but a strategy is required. I guess I need to get an idea of what constitutes a "portion" using the five-a-day methodology and which vegetables I'm most likely to eat on any given day. One thing that I haven't done for a while which I know has worked in the past is to visit the market in Lewisham and purchase an abundant supply of vegetables. Then I'm thinking of ways to use up the glut of produce before it turns to waste. There, I think I have a plan.</p>
<p>During the final few days of the month I thought a lot about the 5-a-day idea and whether it would be possible to implement into my lifestyle. To that end I have decided to employ the methods that I'm using to monitor my other goals and just keep track in Evernote. Aside from the handy little methods such as seven cherry tomatoes being one portion I've seen that the general rule is that 80g is one portion. Which means that the total amount needs to be 400g of vegetables. That doesn't actually sound like a lot. Perhaps it could be quite easy. And by the way, I used the Body Trax body composition scanner at the Peak Health Club where I teach which told me that my current level of body fat is 9.4%. Therefore, my body fat goal has been achieved!</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>Generally chugging along although I have missed a few sessions due to bike rides. There is something rather tedious and perfunctory about the sessions that sometimes can cause me to want to avoid them but it has become such a part of my routine now that I don't really think about whether I want to do it or not but just get on with it. A little more excitement would be good though.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p>Things seem to have slowed down this month. I sent a few books to my cousin but other than that I haven't even thrown out small amounts. There is still a slight reluctance to discard items that could potentially be sold on eBay or have some sort of dormant value but there are items that clearly have no purpose and need to go. I shouldn't underestimate the power of the black bin bag.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>On this the very first day of the month as I did last month I began by riding 100km or 107km to be exact. This wasn't an actual audax ride but a route that I have taken from bigfoot.cc and edited slightly taking in the Kent Downs and the Surrey Hills. So far this year I've been riding mainly my fixed gear bike but today was on my geared bike especially as there were some tough climbs. I would say that there were five in all but they all seemed a bit easier than the last time I rode this route as I've been riding long distances on fixed consistently this year. There were also some strong headwinds but the weather was gorgeous. I left the house at 0700 and was home at 1200 which is pretty fast for a slowcoach like me. I made two short 10 minutes stops and was pushing quite hard most of the way rather than taking it easy. I certainly have become a whole lot stronger and fitter. All these extra rides in addition to the actual audax rides are both to maintain my general level but also to get myself ready for that first 300 in April.</p>
<p>Yesterday the 4th of March I did another very long training ride: to Cambridge and back. A little over 200km which should set me up for the forthcoming London-Oxford-London on the 15th which is my next audax ride. This time I wasn't alone and rode with three others for part of the way and one other for the whole distance. The one other is called Brad and we have met a few times on audax rides last year. We became aware that we are both doing training rides in between actual audax rides and as we live very close to each other we decided to train together. We met at 0700 at Tower Bridge along with another friend called Greg and made our way to Highams Park in NE London. Greg knows the area very well and took us on a route through backstreets to avoid the heavy rush hour traffic. At Highams Park we met another friend Diego then set off for Much Hadham. The weather was very pleasant but a little on the chilly side with a touch of headwind. We stopped at the village shop in Much Hadham for snacks then made a long stop at Artisan Cycles. On Wednesdays I usually do strength training unless it's a full days ride when I tend to skip it. I did a couple of sets of pull ups on the roof rafter braces. Couldn't help myself as I felt surprisingly fresh. After food and coffee Brad and I set off for Cambridge. We rode non-stop for the whole 48km that remained. There were strong headwinds for most of the way which made the clear bright sunny day less than pleasant but we soldiered on. Having seen "The Theory of Everything" at the cinema the previous day which is set largely in Cambridge it was quite magical to be there. Having arrived at lunchtime we found most of the eateries near the vicinity of our arrival to be full. There was also nowhere to park our bikes. Cambridge being a cycling city has a large population of bicycles and every parking place within eyeshot was occupied. In spite of the slight chill we opted to sit outside with the bikes right next to us. We ate at the West Cornwall Pasty place and both seemed to enjoy it. The temperature wasn't too cold when the sun was out. After a goodly feed we began our journey back. Thankfully the wind had dropped which made for much more pleasant riding. I suggested we stop more frequently but for shorter intervals but in the end we rode the whole way back to Much Hadham again without a break. More food and snacks followed by the final leg back to Walthamstow. This section was during the evening rush hour and even in the country lanes we were met with heavy traffic. The section along the Epping Road was especially unpleasant with narrow roads and vehicles passing us at great speed. I will change the route to avoid this section in the future although on the outward journey the traffic is not so busy. At the end of Wood Street we took another short break before making our way across the metropolis. I had a route in my Garmin that took us via cycle paths to Tower Bridge where we parted company. I continued on the cycle paths even though the main roads may have been quicker: after riding quiet country lanes the heavy London traffic can come as quite a shock. I got home around 2030 and got myself a kebab; a well deserved kebab.</p>
<p>Following that ride to Cambridge I had a day of commuting and then effectively three days off the bike then a couple more days of commuting which should have been followed by a long training ride but that was prevented by a bad nights sleep due to stomach pains. This left me feeling weak the following day and I thought it best to rest and recover. I skipped my strength training as well that day, the 11th. But on the 13th, the Friday, I did a shorter 63km ride into Kent while fasting and also rode it non-stop followed immediately by strength training when I got home. Got to test out a new front wheel that I had built the night before with a new Schmidt SON dynamo hub. Everything was pretty smooth and I feel all set for the audax on Sunday. But it's Saturday as I write and the forecast for Sunday is heavy rain which doesn't make me too keen to ride. I was planning on riding to the start and adding an extra 80km to the 200km distance which is already a challenge but being wet all day is not a thought that I relish. Don't think I'm hard enough for that.</p>
<p>After a short text message conversation with Brad who rode with me on the London Cambridge London training ride I decided that if I did choose to abandon the ride then I would be very disappointed if I found that the weather was good enough to ride. Brad's take was that it would be better to make a start and then leave it if the weather was too adverse to continue. We met at the Imperial War Museum at 0530 along with another rider who asked to join us from the lfgss.com forum. Brad took us on a route along the canal after we arrived at Paddington which was quiet and traffic free especially at that time on a Sunday morning. At the very end though there was a short walk through the woods until we arrived at Ruislip Lido. There was no rain so far. We found a whole host of riders for the Steam Ride or LOL, London-Oxford-London. There was a big queue for the brevet cards and I met some others that I had met on previous rides. Made me feel like an old hand somewhat. We set off and our other rider shot off ahead leaving Brad and myself riding the rest of the route together. Heavy rain had been forecast but we didn't actually see any of it till three in the afternoon. It was in fact only medium heavy and lasted for about half an hour. The route was fairly flat and took us through the village of Quainton where we met others who we knew as well as stopping for tea and cake. Then via the Chilterns on the return leg from Oxford, taking us through Didcot and Chinnor. We had to collect a receipt as proof of passage at both of these control points so took the opportunity to eat more snacks and take a short break. Having been training regularly the ride itself was fairly straightforward and my new SON wheel performed really well. Adding an extra 60km to the distance set me up very well for the forthcoming 300. I felt quite fresh at the end of the day in spite of riding 260km which I think is probably the furthest I've ridden in a day.</p>
<p>Got up early on the 23rd which was a fasting day and rode the 40 mile ride to PolHill and Chipstead. It was quite a nice morning and I rode it non-stop and even managed to take about 15 minutes off my time. I did however feel quite a bit of reluctance to ride but once I was out there I enjoyed it very much. I had had Maya stay with me over the weekend and she had a temperature so I wondered if I had contracted something during that time. Having been on the training rollers the day before the whole ride did feel a lot smoother.</p>
<p>I had had in mind to go for a longer ride on the 25th as the day was free from appointments and would have been a good way to keep my fitness topped up ready for the 200 on Saturday 28th but in the end submitted to the pressure of work and spent the day catching up with wheel build orders and websites.</p>
<p>On Friday the 27th I was all ready for my ride. I had finished the mapping, made sure that my Garmin batteries had been charged and had given the bike a general once over. But even though I managed to get to bed quite early I didn't sleep well. I woke up at around 01:00 and then found myself overheating. It took me some time to get back to sleep so that when the alarm sounded at 04:00 I turned it off and went back to sleep. I slept till 07:00 and then informed the organiser that I wouldn't be attending due to ill health. I then slept again till 10:00 and felt a lot worse than I had felt the day before. So even though I missed the ride I didn't feel too bad about it because I had already completed my 200 for March (the LOL) and was obviously to unwell to get out of bed let alone ride.</p>

<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p>In a bid to increase my programming hours I assigned myself a programming day to pick up where I left off in December but it was on the day just before the audax on the 15th and I was so focused on the ride that I couldn't concentrate my efforts on the programming. I defined a day as consisting of clocking at least 6 hours but by the end of the day I had only clocked half an hour. I didn't start until about 2.00pm and perhaps that affected the outcome and perhaps I was expecting too much of myself. But I'm not giving up and will assign another day before the month is over.</p>
<p>Having missed my bike ride on the 28th I decided that I should make the weekend into a programming weekend. However, due to the fact that I was rather poorly my motivation to do such a thing was very low. I watched a couple of Vim tutorials and installed a couple of new plugins. Then on the Sunday I worked with the ruby koans and a programming challenge from CodeEval. My goal was to clock up at least 8 hours over the weekend but in the end I managed 2 hours. It's not much when you've assigned a whole day but it's still a whole lot more than the last time when I only managed half an hour.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>During March I've been gradually establishing my routine again with the typing training. From the Type Scout website where I still have many days remaining in my account. I have been doing two exercises: the Typetris one and the text writing game where you can put in your own text to use as the exercise. I've been using this very blogpost as it gets updated during the month which means it's a way of proof reading what I've written to check for spelling errors and grammar errors. It also affords me the chance to alter my phraseology.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I really must finish Moby Dick during the first few days of March and get started on a new book. This really is taking far too long.</p>
<p>In both January and February this year I did manage to dedicate a day to the reading day but found that I got distracted incessantly. Today (2nd) I thought about what a "day" actually meant. I realised that I haven't defined it clearly. When I think of a reading day I sort of imagine myself reading for the whole day without doing much else. But there are other regular tasks during that day such as perhaps strength training or yoga: the reading day has to work around these regular fixtures. If this is the case then what would I consider to be a successful "day" be it reading or programming? As I've been logging my hours this year it falls upon the number of hours accrued on the day. As a realistic target I'm going to assign six hours i.e. greater than or equal to six hours of actual reading whether at home or preferably at a café or library being the mark of a successful "day". With a little planning the day before I think this is well within my means and still leaves ample time to carry out the regular fixtures.</p>
<p>I've finally finished Moby Dick on the 7th of March. Blimey, that took a while did it not?</p>
<p>I've started my next book which is Gulliver's Travels. I sort of knew the story but wanted to read it to enjoy the writers style and continue with my journey into the classics.</p>
<p>On the very last day of the month I finished Gulliver's Travels and spent a little time browsing the Kindle store for classics. I settled on two which were The Time Machine by H. G. Wells and Three Men in a Boat by Jerome K. Jerome. Having watched a movie about Stephen Hawking recently I opted for the Time Machine and have already made a start. I have already found three words that I had to look up but I am tracking them on vocabulary.com which is a website I've started using in order to keep track of new words and generally improve my vocabulary. That's three months and two books. I think the Time Machine is a fairly short one as well as Three Men in a Boat so by the end of April I may have completed four and have caught up with my goal of one book a month.</p>
<p>On the 18th which was a Wednesday I decided to have a Reading Day. I made some preparations the day before which made it work better than the previous time I tried to do it. This time I went straight out of the door in the morning and planned to get a couple of hours in before getting on with the tasks of the day. I went to the library in Forest Hill and read for half an hour there then continued on to the Cherry &amp; Ice café in Sydenham where I took breakfast (of vegetable lasagne) and read for another half an hour or so. But in the end due to various tasks I clocked only three hours, however I did enjoy those hours and it was a good deal more than the previous attempt. I made a good inroad into the book (Gulliver's Travels) and having thought about the café in advance did help a great deal in making it a day of literary pleasure. The things that made it difficult was that I was teaching yoga that day and I also had a lot of wheels to build.</p>
