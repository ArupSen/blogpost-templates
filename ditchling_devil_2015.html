<!-- Ditchling Devil 2015 -->
<p>On the 7th of June 2015 I rode the Ditchling Devil Audax. It was much anticipated because I rode it last year as perm and wanted to ride it again this year as a scheduled calendar ride.</p>
<p>I rode to the start on Wimbledon Common with Brad and the traffic being almost non-existent at 7.00am on a Sunday morning we arrived a lot earlier than I had anticipated. Having looked at the weather forecast I imagined that it would be quite warm and opted to dress in only cycling shorts and a short sleeved top but I found it cold. I had goose bumps on my arms and was shivering by the time we arrived. Brad was wearing arm warmers and I think I will get the same for the next ride that starts early when it's still a little chilly.</p>
<p>There were big bowls full of donuts and biscuits and more riders than I've seen before on a ride before. There were many cycling clubs such as Kingston Wheelers, Twickenham CC and Dulwich Paragon. They all rode together and were very fast. Sometimes I was envious of their speeds but no awards are given for speed in Audax. My main aim this year is to complete the RRtY challenge and that is only about finishing the ride: speed plays no part, only inasmuch as you finish inside the allotted maximum time.</p>
<p>I put on my soft shell rain jacket as I was so cold and ate another biscuit every few minutes and then packed a couple of donuts just in case. More for security than for any other reason as we would inevitably pass a village shop at some point. The riders were setting off in batches as there were so many. The count was around the 300 mark. I would have ridden with Brad but he was waiting for a friend who was riding his first 200 and so was arriving by train and was also running late. He suggested that I make a start and he would catch up with me later. I looked around to see if Luke was there but I couldn't spot him.</p>
<p>I kept my jacket on for a good while as it took me some time to warm up again. Good thing that I had packed it. It seemed easy to keep pace with the group I was with perhaps due to the roller training that I had been doing the previous week. The weather was nice, not too warm, not too cold, the bike felt good and I felt on good form. Happy inside. Glad that I had made it. The first control was around the 50km mark in Highbrook and it was a manned control so there was no need to keep checking the brevet card as I tend to do on other rides. On the way to the start I had wondered if I would be riding with Brad and his friend or with Luke or as a group but actually wanted to ride alone as is my wont so I was quite pleased that it had worked out this way. It took a good hour and half before I had warmed up sufficiently to stop and remove my jacket. I wasn't going particularly fast or slow but at a pace that felt comfortable to me. Having ridden the route last year I remembered many hills but this year I didn't notice anything major other than Ditchling Beacon road and Coombe Lane. There was one other called Tongdean Lane. All of these are fairly challenging climbs and I think that most riders would agree.Aside from these three I managed to stay in the big ring.</p>
<p>At the first control we entered a walled field which resembled a churchyard with no graves. There were a couple of gazebos there with lots of food. The bacon and egg rolls are what attracted most people. They were all laid out ready to grab: no queueing. This was amazing in terms of organisation. Often the control may be at a commercial caf√© and involves queueing and paying. A lot of time can be used up just doing this let alone the actual sitting down and eating. This can cause a lot of frustration if you want to pass through quickly. The way this was set up meant that you could eat and pass as quickly as you wanted. I ate my egg and bacon roll, took a drink, took a couple of photos, tweeted and having got my card stamped was soon on my way. Toilet? I had already relieved myself in the woods a little way prior to the control again removing the need to queue and having the choice of passing through quickly.</p>
<p>The next control was at the top of Ditchling Beacon which was another 25km away. It's a tough climb; long and winding with a few very steep sections. It's a climb that everyone dreads on this route and one that gives the ride its name. For some reason I was looking forward to it. I remembered the surface to be rough and the road narrow but it seemed to have been widened and resurfaced perhaps due to its increased usage. It was certainly tough but not quite as tough as I had expected and far easier than last year. I took a moment to scribble down the answer to the info question and eat one of the donuts that I had packed. One of the great rewards of climbing is to take in the view and enjoy a descent. One of the things that I really hate about Audax rides are info controls. But they are one way for the organiser to make sure that the rider passes through the required distance. Often the question on the card tends to be obscure and riders can stop longer than they need trying to find what is required. This ride had only 2 such information controls and exactly where they are required: at the summit of a climb. The required answer was posted clearly with the Audax symbol and very easy to find. Other organisers could learn from this. It's about riding and not about being Hercule Poirot.</p>
<p>A long and fast descent then took us down through Hollingdean and Withdean and then up through Tongdean on to Devil's Dyke road. Not a steep climb as such but nevertheless a very long one with beautiful vistas along the way. The sun was out now with warm fluffy clouds ambling across the sky beckoning us to the top. Another info control and again clearly labelled. I got an ice cream from a van and watched the paraponts. Some were way up in the sky. As I wheeled my bike back to where I had entered I bumped into Luke. We said our hellos as I finished my ice cream. He said that he had arrived late and had been "bouncing" controls and that he would happy to leave immediately if I was about to leave and it meant that we could ride together. So that is what we did.</p>
<p>A delicious long and winding descent but we seemed to have lost each other along the way. The route took us along the base of the hills and we could see Devil's Dyke and the paraponters by looking upwards. The lunch control was only 11km away in Upper Beeding and once again it was very well thought out. It was in a private house which I later found to be the house of a chairman of a cycling club. There were a few gazebos set up and it was very much like garden party. Pizza and pasta in abundance and once again the option to sit and chat or "bounce". "Bouncing" is a term used by Audax riders to denote stopping very briefly or not at all at a control. When I arrived I looked around for Luke but couldn't see him. By the time he arrived I had already eaten enough and thought about setting off but decided to wait until he had eaten too. But then he started chatting and so did I and before I knew it we had been there for more than half an hour. But as I have already mentioned, Audaxes are not about speed, nevertheless I was getting a bit frustrated. Luke says that he is a victim to what he calls "faffage" which means that it takes him a while to get things done and get up and going when he stops. He did say that he was bouncing controls today but I could see the slip back to "faffage".</p>
<p>After lunch the next control was over 40km away, so we were in for a long haul. It was comparatively flat after the earlier climbs. We managed to chat on occasion when the roads were quiet. Luke road in front for most of the way but I found I was having to slow myself down to a pace that was below one that I would have used had I gone on my own. Was it due to him having spent his effort during the earlier part of the ride or was easier for me riding behind and being pulled? On the one hand it was nice to go at a pace that was easier than I would have liked but it was at times very frustrating. But such is the price of company. Towards the end of that stage I brought up the subject of cake and we we were both fantasizing about it. We really hoped that there would cake at the next control.</p>
<p>At Chiddingfold, the next control, our cake dreams came true. A village hall next to a green with tables in a row laid with cakes made by the local women's institute. Once again I bow down to the greatness of the organisation. There was even a man standing next to the short drive that led to the green directing us. This is one organiser who is inside the mind of an Audax rider and made this a dream ride. Tea and cake, seconds, a little sit down and then on our way once more.</p>
<p>The final leg was almost 60km and took us into the Surrey Hills. The last climbs of the day and the long descent to the finish. I wanted to break this leg into two and Luke suggested Cobham. After a few short climbs through woods and tree lined roads we went through the village of Blackheath. A real sense of the Medieval period if I am not mistaken. (According to Wikipedia it dates back to 1086 which was during the Norman era during the Middle Ages a.k.a. the Medieval period.) Shortly after this and more early Middle Age buildings we were greeted by Coombe Hill: a long steep climb which seems to end at one point only to get even steeper. I was being a bit cocky thinking I could reach the top and stay in the big ring but soon had to change to the smaller inner ring. From then on it was all downhill. Firstly some sharp descents within the woods, which I found scary as the roads were dark and lumpy with a pothole hiding somewhere along the way. Coming out of the woods there were more descents but now on good roads and with the late afternoon sun.</p>
<p>I was thinking that we would have a simple leg stretch, a quick bite and be on our way but Luke wanted a coffee. We went to a Strada restaurant and had a proper sit down. Luke ordered iced coffees and ice cream for himself. I am not a coffee drinker as a rule but decided to join him along with my order of cheesecake. A civilised break. We stopped for more than 20 minutes and then got on our way. It was just after 6.00 when we left and still had 23km to ride. We predicted about an hour but Luke noticed that the final control closed at 7.00 and moved to another venue: could we make it to the first? We arrived a few minutes before 7.00 but went to the second venue. I was actually keen to get home even though the club riders were sitting in groups pouring beer into their throats. Having hoisted the Audax flag and got the paperwork the organiser arrived. The card was validated and returned. Done.</p>
<p>As we were about to leave Brad arrived with his friend. After some brief greetings we set off for home. We parted inside Richmond Park and arranged to meet and ride together again at the next Audax. I felt a little heavy during my journey home but surprisingly fresh.</p>
