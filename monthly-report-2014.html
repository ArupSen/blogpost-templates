<p>September has just finished and the weather is still warm. I'm sure that it will change suddenly though as it does every year. I seem to have got the programming bug again this month and have booked myself onto a course which starts at the beginning of October i.e. in a couple of days.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Working out</h4>
<p>I have been very consistent with this and fairly enthusiastic about it on most occasions. Not really much more to say except that I'm enjoying it, it still only takes about 15 minutes 3 times per week and I can feel the benefits. Sometimes I do think about taking it to the next level such as doing more sets or introducing other body parts into the session but I think part of the beauty of it is that it is so short and sharp: those times when I don't really feel like doing it before I've even had a chance to think about it it's done.</p></li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p>I don't think that my diet has been getting any healthier, in fact I think it has been getting less healthy. Since stating the 5:2 diet I have been losing fat and I'm assuming that it's fat weight, but on my non-fast days I have been indulging a bit too much. A cake here and a sausage there. Eating all manner of treats because I know that I won't get the chance to do it when I'm fasting again. What I'm hoping for is that this will settle down when I'm into this program more long term and I realise that not only do I have 5 days to eat my unhealthy treats but those 5 days are the only chance I have to eat more nutritious food too.</p></li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>Things have been very steady in terms of my yoga practice. One distracting thing that I've been doing is to watch programming tutorials while I'm doing yoga but at least I'm on the mat and doing some form of yoga better than nothing at all. Lately what I've also been experiencing is that I'm not really sure what to do when I get on the mat so I've been following a routine that I do with one of my private students. We've been working on a similar routine for more than 2 years so I guess if it's good enough for him then it's good enough for me.</p></li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p>Small stuff but there is still stuff going out. But as I've said many times I'm getting to the point where it's getting hard to decide as to whether some things should be kept or thrown out. But I guess another six months of further indecision should help me to decide: if I still have it and still haven't used it then time to go. I've managed to discard a fair amount of paper stashed away in my filing system, paper that is blank on one side. What I've done is to slice this up with my paper cutter into precise A5 and A6 sheets which are great for jotting down notes and lists. Very handy.</p></li>
<li><h4>Audax</h4>
<p>No audax rides at all in September. I was so into it in July especially after my first DIY ride but already in August I had lost some of that impetus. I was very concerned about losing the fitness level that I had developed but the more I regained my enthusiasm of programming and computing the less concerned I became about riding. Now I'm a little concerned that I'm not concerned especially as my enthusiasm for riding was so high only a few weeks ago but there you have it, emotions are fickle: you think you want something so badly that you would give anything to get it and before you know it you don't value it at all. I'm not saying that I no longer value cycling any more, far from it but my enthusiasm certainly has dropped tremendously.</p></li>
<li><h4>Bike training</h4>
<p>No, no bike training. I sometimes think about getting some rollers but just like the turbo trainer idea it's all in the thinking and planning rather than the actual execution. The weather has been quite nice and if I am not managing to get out and ride then I don't think a set of rollers or a turbo trainer are going to do much.</p></li>
<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p>The plan in September was to do a kind of intensive programming month so that it would lead nicely into my Programming Languages course starting at the beginning of October. Well, I certainly did that. I spent a fair amount of time studying Angular JS and also studying development tools such as Tmux and levelling up my vim skills. Alongside this I also enjoyed doing a few Code Eval challenges in Javascript.</p></li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>As with the workout I do around 15 minutes a day. Sometimes I wonder whether it's making any difference: am I improving in speed and accuracy? One would hope so no? After doing all those exercises but I get the impression that I haven't really progressed that much at all. I guess I should do a test or something to find out.</p></li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I started reading Walden by Thoreau. It has been on my 'must read' list for a good while.</p></li>
<li><h4>Staying in touch with friends</h4>
<p>It seems that the best way to keep in touch with friends when you have little time is to write text messages. Text messages are now becoming as long as shorter emails but somehow more quick and immediate with no room for formality. You have to be succinct and to the point. The main thing is that because it is so quick it's easy to do and there is no reason to put it off.</p></li>
</ul>
