<p>October and November have been very busy months particularly due to the Programming Languages course which started on the 3rd of October. I've been trying to devote as much time as I can to this but obviously have the usual regular time commitments such as yoga classes, bike wheels to build and web sites to create and update. There is also spending time with my daughter every other weekend along with general entertainment and leisure. </p>
<p>Towards the end of November in a bid to get a lot done without a break I sacrificed good postural habits in order to get a wheel built. I was basically sitting for too long a period in a bowed position. I could feel the pain and discomfort increase but didn't change my position even though it was clear that what I was doing wasn't good for me. I got the job done but at a price. That weekend I had also had very little sleep and the cold weather had started. That same evening I could feel the pain in the lower back grow worse. The next day it was perhaps slightly worse but again I did not exercise caution - I rode my bike to the bank followed by doing my strength routine. As I suspected this aggravated the condition to the extent that I had to rest for the following few days. I was not able to work or even walk very much. The pain was acute and intense. I couldn't sit or stand for very long.</p>
<p>The only upside was to have some time off and be at home when builders needed to access the flat to repair the back door and bathroom tap. These were long overdue repairs that the landlord finally actioned so it was good that I was able to oversee them. I also did some studying but as I was in a lot of pain and feeling sorry for myself I wasn't able to use the time as effectively as I would have liked. Three weeks later the pain has almost gone but I am now very aware of sloppy posture and of course how it can lead to very detrimental results.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Working out</h4>
<p>Fairly consistent and going to failure on most days. Obviously took a break at the end of November due to the back pain.</p></li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p>My diet has been twofold due to the fasting regime which still continues on Mondays and Fridays.</p></li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p></p></li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p></p></li>
<li><h4>Audax</h4>
<p></p></li>
<li><h4>Bike training</h4>
<p>Since doing more programming and studying this is one thing that has fallen by the wayside. It's clear that if did get work doing programming and gave up my yoga classes in town that my cycling could be neglected even further which is rather worrying. I've also been taking the train when the weather is less than ideal which is something that I would not have considered in the past. The week following the back pain I obviously took the train but 2 - 3 days of commuting per week really is rock bottom in terms of a regular cycling regime so skipping days on top of that using public transport only makes a bad situation worse.</p></li>
<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p></p></li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>I've been doing my 15 minutes a day with Type Scout and I think it's helping. The short amount of time feels very unobtrusive but nevertheless consistent enough. I do feel sometimes that perhaps I ought to do a bit more but if I do have time then I tend to extend the session but the object was to have ongoing practice rather than a short blast with no improvement to follow after that. Going through the Type Scout exercises I've found that there are many keys mapped to the little finger of the right hand and I have noticed that I tend to twist my wrist to reach them. Obviously this will cause pain and possible injury if not checked so I have been looking at more ergonomic techniques to make typing more relaxed and natural rather than purely going for speed and accuracy, after all I'm not under a massive time pressure that I'm required to type really fast such as a PA or similar role.</p></li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I didn't read any form of novel literature but did read a few programming books and the Chimp Paradox by Dr. Steve Peters.</p></li>
<li><h4>Staying in touch with friends</h4>
<p></p></li>
