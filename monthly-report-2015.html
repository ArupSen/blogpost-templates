<p>The end of one month seems to have blurred into the beginning of the next. On the one I'm busy but on the other hand I'm trying not to be busy. It's the 7th already as I start this months report which also heralds the 2nd half of the year and also 5 years since I moved into this flat in Sydenham. But when you think about it, these are all arbitrary markers of time. Days are still made up of mornings, afternoons and evenings and that fact will never change.</p>

<p>Rode my first unofficial 400km along with two fellow audax riders. It was the Dunwich Dynamo ride which I've been wanting to ride for a while. We rode there and back. I've written more fully about in a dedicated post rather than make this one too cluttered.</p>
