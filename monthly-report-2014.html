<p>September has just finished and the weather is still warm. I'm sure that it will change suddenly though as it does every year. I seem to have got the programming bug again this month and have booked myself onto a course which starts at the beginning of October i.e. in a couple of days.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Working out</h4>
<p></p></li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p></p></li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p></p></li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p></p></li>
<li><h4>Audax</h4>
<p>No audax rides at all in September. I was so into it in July especially after my first DIY ride but already in August I had lost some of that impetus. I was very concerned about losing the fitness level that I had developed but the more I regained my enthusiasm of programming and computing the less concerned I became about riding. Now I'm a little concerned that I'm not concerned especially as my ethusiasm for riding was so high only a few weeks ago but there you have it, emotions are fickle: you think you want something so badly that you would give anything to get it and before you know it you don't value it at all. I'm not saying that I no longer value cycling any more, far from it but my enthusiasm certainly has dropped tremendously. </p></li>
<li><h4>Bike training</h4>
<p></p></li>
<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p></p></li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p></p></li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I started reading Walden by Thoreau. It has been on my 'must read' list for a good while.</p></li>
<li><h4>Staying in touch with friends</h4>
<p>It seems that the best way to keep in touch with friends when you have little time is to write text messages. Text messages are now becoming as long as shorter emails but somehow more quick and immediate with no room for formality. You have to be succinct and to the point. The main thing is that because it is so quick it's easy to do and there is no reason to put it off.</p></li>
</ul>
