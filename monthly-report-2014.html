<p>October and November have been very busy months particularly due to the Programming Languages course which started on the 3rd of October. I've been trying to devote as much time as I can to this but obviously have the usual regular time commitments such as yoga classes to teach, bike wheels to build and web sites to create and update. There is also spending time with my daughter every other weekend along with general entertainment and leisure.</p>
<p>Towards the end of November in a bid to get a lot done without a break I sacrificed good postural habits in order to get a wheel built. I was basically sitting for too long a period in a bowed position. I could feel the pain and discomfort increase but didn't change my position even though it was clear that what I was doing wasn't good for me. I got the job done but at a price. That weekend I had also had very little sleep and the cold weather had started. That same evening I could feel the pain in the lower back grow worse. The next day it was perhaps slightly worse but again I did not exercise caution - I rode my bike followed by doing my strength routine. As I suspected this aggravated the condition to the extent that I had to rest for the following few days. I was not able to work or even walk very much. The pain was acute and intense. I couldn't sit or stand for very long.</p>
<p>The only upside was to have some time off and be at home when builders needed to access the flat to repair the back door and bathroom tap. These were long overdue repairs that the landlord finally actioned so it was good that I was able to oversee them. I also did some studying but as I was in a lot of pain and feeling sorry for myself I wasn't able to use the time as effectively as I would have liked. Three weeks later the pain has almost gone but I am now very aware of sloppy posture and of course how it can lead to very detrimental results.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Working out</h4>
<p>Fairly consistent and going to failure on most days. Obviously took a break at the end of November due to the back pain. Surprisingly only lost a few reps in some exercises after the break. I had expected it to be much worse.</p></li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p>My diet has been twofold due to the fasting regime which still continues on Mondays and Fridays. On the one hand it has been healthy and frugal which satisfies the healthy side of my nature but I have also been indulging myself with a good deal of junk food which of course satisfies my hedonistic side. But I think that after 3 months or so of this 5:2 fasting diet I've had my fill of junk food and don't feel the need to consume it excessively on my non-fasting days. In spite of the increased intake of junk food I have still managed to lose around 11kg in bodyweight and feel very good about myself which means that both my hedonistic self and my healthy self have been fulfilled.</p></li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>I think that this one really has become a habit. Every day at 18:00 if I'm not teaching that day I take out the mat and do some yoga. It's fairly similar to what I teach and I tend to include postures that address the areas that are stiff that day or work according to my mood which is again totally in keeping with what I teach my students. I do often like the idea of having a more ambitious goal and following some sort of course but at the same time I'm really happy that it's just ticking over on a regular basis.</p></li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p>Having the reminder go off every Friday at 09:00 does motivate me to discard items that I no longer require or wish to keep for memories. I do have many items that I'm undecided about though and I find that rather difficult. Keeping a record of what could be discarded on a room by room basis is indeed helping to keep track and most of all lose what I don't use.</p></li>
<li><h4>Audax</h4>
<p>The last audax that I did was in August and since spending more time at the computer I seem to have forgotten about my passion for cycling. Perhaps it's more dormant than forgotten at the moment like a short period of hibernation.</p></li>
<li><h4>Bike training</h4>
<p>Since doing more programming and studying this is one thing that has fallen by the wayside. It's clear that if did get work doing programming and gave up my yoga classes in town that my cycling could be neglected even further which is rather worrying. I've also been taking the train when the weather is less than ideal which is something that I would not have considered in the past. The week following the back pain I obviously took the train but 2 - 3 days of commuting per week really is rock bottom in terms of a regular cycling regime so skipping days on top of that using public transport only makes a bad situation worse. I have considered getting myself a set of rollers but wonder if this is more an excuse for a purchase rather than a genuine urge to train. How is it that I don't just go out on my bike when I do have the time and the weather is fine? It's a question that it would good to take time to answer.</p></li>
<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p>As I've mentioned already I have been following the Programming Languages course on Coursera as offered by the University of Washington. I have attempted this course twice before and only got as far as week 3 of a 10 week course. On this occasion however I have made it all the way to the end with varying amounts of effort each week. It really has improved my understanding of how programming languages work, my own ability to program and most of all my own curiosity and love of the subject. This latter aspect was the one I valued the most. Having been a little bit inconsistent with my efforts over the years I really wanted to get behind the surface a little and to see if understanding the inner workings would motivate me further. Well it certainly has done that and well beyond the idea of it being a vocational training. I really want to learn more and also don't care if that learning will lead to earning more money.</p></li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>I've been doing my 15 minutes a day with Type Scout and I think it's helping. The short amount of time feels very unobtrusive but nevertheless consistent enough. I do feel sometimes that perhaps I ought to do a bit more but if I do have time then I tend to extend the session but the object was to have ongoing practice rather than a short blast with no improvement to follow after that. Going through the Type Scout exercises I've found that there are many keys mapped to the little finger of the right hand and I have noticed that I tend to twist my wrist to reach them. Obviously this will cause pain and possible injury if not checked so I have been looking at more ergonomic techniques to make typing more relaxed and natural rather than purely going for speed and accuracy, after all I'm not under a massive time pressure that I'm required to type really fast such as a PA or similar role.</p></li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I didn't read any form of novel literature but did read a few programming books and the Chimp Paradox by Dr. Steve Peters.</p></li>
<li><h4>Staying in touch with friends</h4>
<p>Haven't really thought about this one much over the past couple of months so if I have managed to keep up with it then it has been more by chance than by conscious effort. But then you could also argue that it's not chance but habits that have developed through previous attempts and efforts. For example I might write a random text message to a friend which seems to be totally random and unplanned because I have been unconcerned with the idea of keeping in touch with friends but the urge to write the message did come from somewhere. I would argue that it came as a result of what might be called previous training i.e. having consciously and actively developed a methodical approach to keeping in touch with friends. It would be interesting to see if there was a tipping point so to speak such that if I spent a certain amount of uninterrupted time pursuing this goal (or any other goal for that matter) how long would it take before it would happen as a habitual process so that no conscious effort on my part was required and that pursuing the goal would just 'happen'.</p></li>
