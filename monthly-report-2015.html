<p>It's the 5th of September and I feel a bit behind as I'm only starting this months report today and I haven't put out last month's report just yet. But then what does it really matter. I mean it goes on my blog and apart from me there are only a handful of people that read it, if that. But I've been doing it for a long time on a regular basis and it has become a habit and I tend to feel out of sorts if I don't do it. Is it a crutch? Perhaps that's not the best analogy more like healthy food or general training that keeps me on the ball. By writing these reports I look back over the recent past and reflect back to myself how I'm doing.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>August has been carried over into September and my current workout of three supersets is working rather well. I often think back to the days when I could barely do one pull-up and in this workout I'm doing 10 sets of 5 or a total of 50! That is way beyond the expectations I would have had at the time and now it's just normal.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>It's the 13th of September and the day after an Audax ride. Probably the hardest ride that I've ridden this year but it had to be done as it was the only calendar ride that would have fitted into my schedule. 300km and extremely hilly with 4.5 AAA or Audax Altitude Award points. I'll write a separate more detailed post about it. I haven't done any other rides this month even for training and now that this one is done and my RRtY quota for this month done I am free to ride or not ride. Hopefully I'll get another long ride in this month though. I had my eye on a calendar ride on the 26th of the month called Cheddar Gorgeous but have a Samaritans shift on that date.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p>I signed to part 2 of Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python from Rice University as I did Part 1 a couple of years ago but as expected I haven't really found the time to devote myself to it. Hopefully the next offering though. In the meantime I have been tying up many other jobs and projects so that I can focus a bit more on my programming studies. I have been doing Code School courses, Code Eval problems, watching lectures and tutorials on functional aspects of javascript and reading 'You don't know JS'. I'm into it, I'm really into it.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>When I stopped doing this a few months ago I had the excuse of freeing time to do roller training but I no longer have that excuse. The reminder still goes off on my phone which of course makes me think about it so I think I'll gradually drift back into it this month. But no pressure as I'm fairly happy with my speed at the moment but the accuracy could do with some work.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>Having missed reading altogether during the last few days of August and pretty much the first few days of September too I have started up again today on the 7th. Still reading the Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne. The style is very different to any that I have read before but has some allure. I should imagine that I will continue with this till the end, either of the book or the month. I've set a Reading Day for this month on the 13th, something that has been missed many times this year. Hopefully, being on a day following a ride might allow me to just chill out and read.</p>
<p>Today is the 13th but Reading Day didn't really happen. I was far more tired than I had expected after the ride and didn't manage to sleep well. I did manage to read for my usual half an hour but that was about all. I am enjoying the book but wanted to have a more general day off and allow myself to be distracted by distraction. Think I'll have to assign another day this month as it would be nice to have a proper reading day.</p>
