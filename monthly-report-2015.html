<p>May is about to end in half an hour and I'm looking forward to starting a new month. Lots of things got missed in May so I feel like I want to put it all behind and start fresh.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>I almost missed the session on Wednesday 3rd June again due to having been to a meeting during the day but in the end did a partial workout which was better than nothing and I was kind of happy with that. Today, a bit like on Monday 1st I did my workout immediately after my session on the rollers which was great in terms of being warmed up but the session did take some of my strength and energy away which wasn't available for the workout. Still feels like hard work and more like maintenance rather than progress but then seeing how far I have come since I started I have indeed made a lot of progress.</p>

<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>I mentioned last month that I was thinking about quitting my regular Tuesday lunchtime yoga class in order to free up the day. After much toing and froing I finally informed the club that I wanted to give up the class and why. They understood but I told them also that I wanted to continue teaching my other class on Thursdays. The class participants were obviously upset but it had to be done. I want to study and work on my programming chops so from next week on the 9th I will no longer be teaching the Tuesday lunchtime class at the Peak. But it doesn't mean that I should skip yoga but definitely do my own practice.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>Strictly speaking it's not riding but I want to get into using my rollers. I bought them as a means to get on the bike when I wasn't able to get out of the house if it was raining or if Maya was here but it just hasn't been happening and in a way I've forgotten about them. I see my lodger using them on a regular basis and I want to do the same but I still need to go through the initial learning curve. At first I thought about scheduling them in once a week but I don't think I'm going to get used to them that way. I need a more intensive break in period so perhaps if I were to use them every day throughout June. Obviously on some days this won't be possible but certainly I can find 15 minutes or so each of the days when I'm going to be home.</p>
<p>I've started a separate set of posts called 30 days of roller training so have a look at those if you want check my progress.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>This month I've decided to let myself off from typing practice as I'm doing roller training sessions. I still have the reminder on the phone which may trigger me to do it but the pressure is completely off. Hopefully I'll pick it up again in July.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I'm 78% through a book that I was reading last month and ideally I should have finished it and have started a new one this month but it looks as though I'm going to be finishing it during the first week.</p>
