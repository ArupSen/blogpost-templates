<p>Felt very matter of fact today and got on with both hands on the bar. Felt only a very low level of anxiety and even managed to alter my hand positions. My hands remained on the bars throughout and I only touched the wall once or twice briefly with my shoulder. A better sense of confidence and balance and was wondering about an actual roller workout.</p>
