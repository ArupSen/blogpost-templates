<p>One of my goals this year was to ride or rather complete an SR Series. An SR or Super Randonneur is a series of 200, 300, 400 and 600km rides that have to be completed in the same season. Last year I rode my first 300km event and this year in June I rode my first 400km event and looking at the Audax calendar the Buzzard, starting from Leighton Buzzard was the most convenient starting point for me.</p>
<p>The start time was 07:00 on Saturday 9th July and also an X-rated event. That meant no manned controls (checkpoints) and only someone handing out brevet cards at the start: you had to be totally self-reliant i.e. more like a solo ride. I have ridden a good number of perms (non-calendar solo events) and the 400km event that I rode a couple of months ago was also X-rated so I felt comfortable with this prospect.</p>
<p>I arrived at Leighton Buzzard train station at 07:09. The station was the starting / ending point and I decided against getting the earlier train out of London Euston which would have got me in at 06:34: why hang around in a train station car park? I got up at 04:15 and even though my daughter had stayed over I managed not to wake her during my early morning preparations. As per usual I ate 3 rounds of toast (peanut butter and marmalade a la Graham Obree) and one to take with me. I filled my bottles and donned my bike wear. Tights, gloves and arm warmers which would later need to be removed.</p>
<p>I set off at 05:15 for a quiet backstreet ride through London courtesy of <a href="http://cyclestreets.net">cyclestreets.net</a> and arrived with a good 10 minutes to purchase my return ticket at London Euston. &pound;29.10 for a 40 minute ride does seem a lot to me. Must cost commuters a fortune and be a big chunk of their regular costs. It niggled me a little but as this was my first attempt at this distance I didn't want to ride to the start.</p>
<p>One of the things that I had fussed over during the week was luggage. I don't have any problems with this on the fixie as that has a rack and pannier i.e. ample luggage capacity. But my geared racer only has the Ortleib saddle bag which is usually more than half full with only an emergency kit: where would I put my tights, gloves and arm warmers when the sun came out? At first I considered a handlebar bag but there were too many options and due to the short head tube my front light would have been obscured. I also considered getting some other larger saddle bag such as those made by Apidura for bikepackers who like to ride lightweight, but these items are expensive and I am not sure if I want to ride other such events that require sleep stops, so I decided to improvise. My solution was two plastic carrier bags one inside the other to create strength and waterproofing strapped on top of the Ortleib bag in a fat sausage shape and secured with a bungee cord. This actually worked really well except when I loaded it too heavily (with food) and the mounting of the Ortleib bag failed and the whole thing landed on the rear wheel. Aside from a space blanket I didn't pack any sleeping gear as this was new to me and again there was no space for it.</p>
<p>Having arrived at 07:09 I got out of the station on the wrong side and had to go over the footbridge to find the car with the open hatch in the car park. I got my brevet card and a couple of snack bars. I told them that it was my first 600 and they said they had ridden their first the previous year. It was around 07:20 and ticking but these two seemed to want to chat not seeing how anxious I was to get started.</p>
<p>I had the file for the first section already loaded on my Garmin Etrex 20 and as always followed the thick purple line out of the station and into a village called Wing. The organiser had broken up the route or track into 9 separate .gpx files. What I have done in the past is to mark the info or manned controls on the track as waypoints. But as there is no warning to inform you (or I haven't figured out how to do it), I calculate the distances between each control and start paying attention when I am close to that number.It seems obvious now but making the ride a sequence of shorter rides makes it a lot more straight forward. I think I may adopt this strategy on future rides. I wouldn't be spending my thinking time calculating how far it was to the next control or missing an info control. This would also be useful when tracks crossed over such as clover leaf or figure of eight shapes.</p>
<p>The first section was from Leighton Buzzard to Pangbourne. I have been on many rides where Pangbourne was the control so it was a very familiar place. It was 67km away. It was cloudy but warm and I felt at the back of the field having started late. I had noticed two other riders next to their cars still getting ready but I figured they would pass me at some stage. Sure enough within the next hour that was what happened. The route was gently rolling with not much climbing passing through the Chilterns via Chinnor, Watlington, Nuffield and Wallingford.</p>
<p>I don't like to stop at cafes unless I'm riding with someone and even then I am anxious to get going. I prefer to have more numberous but shorter stops rather than longer breaks. At Pangbourne I got snacks and drinks at the supermarket to earn my Proof of Passage receipt. I didn't want to remain 'in town' to take my meal and loaded up my lunch or rather elevenses atop my saddle bag to eat it at a quiet spot in the countryside. Even though I had planned to stop at the first opportunity I didn't find a spot that I liked till about an hour later. There was a section that was along a busy A4 so I didn't want to stop next to busy traffic. Soon the route turned off the main road and a little after a railway level crossing I had found my spot. Kingsclere I recognised from the Willy Warmer ride in January but now going the opposite way. I guess organisers borrow from each other. But this time the route was going South West into Hampshire. The next control was Chandlers Ford a little further South of Winchester, but it took us on a quick tour of Winchester itself rather than totally bypassing it. Just long enough to soak it in. At this point I caught up with a rider that I recognised from two previous Audax rides.</p>
<p>Another Co-op in Chandlers Ford with a row of bike parking racks outside and half a dozen riders snacking and refilling their bottles. There were nods of acknowledgement but no conversation. Local teenagers on BMXs milling about and wondering at the cyclists and pretending to ignore them. I noticed bicycles parked across the road at a cafe but as I've mentioned, it's not my thing when riding solo.</p>
<p>Next was due West to Salisbury. Only 34km. I stopped somewhere en route to eat my lunch which was essentially a big snack as I was snacking all the while at each pit (piss) stop. As Salisbury was so close I didn't buy any food except for a packet of crisps and a drink but on the way I noticed that my luggage solution wasn't really working and that I couldn't load it too heavily or the bracket would collapse and the whole thing would fall on the tyre. I had a bag of dried dates which I put into my jersey pocket and that seemed to do it.</p>
<p>The next section was to Sherborne. Some long pleasant stretches of the A30 and once again heading South West. Some headwinds.Some drizzle. What made my pack heavy were the tights and gloves so it was time to put them on again. The GPS track ended outside a pub and two riders that I had passed climbing a hill into a headwind. The drizzle and headwinds had already sapped my spirits a little and I could also feel the onset of toothache. But seeing these two stop outside the pub really made my heart sink. I saw two other bikes parked outside and not having seen any other shops open other than a pizza place and a kebab place I decided to investigate a sign I'm sure I had seen saying town centre. I found a Waitrose tucked away which was open till 9.00pm. Phew. I hate pubs especially on my own. A bottle of water, a cornish pastie, an addition of layers of clothing and a brief conversation with other riders also 'controlling' at the Waitrose before I set off again.</p>
<p>It was just after 8.20pm and from Sherborne it was a longer stretch of 91km to the halfway point of Exeter. This took us via some pretty Dorset villages such as Crewkerne and Chard. There were stronger and steadier headwinds along with some drizzle and fog. Hills. Having not had much in the way of hills I wasn't expecting anything too difficult but then having seen the route profile I wasn't surprised either. It was actually nice to get out of the saddle and warm up a bit as the wind and moisture did cool you down somewhat. But as it was a warm summer evening it just sort of felt humid. As well as hills there were also long steady descents along quiet wide roads where I first started to experience the nods. Nighttime motorway driving falling asleep at the wheel as it were. Even the drizzle blowing into my face wasn't doing the job of waking me up. Luckily I didn't actually doze. I kept telling myself to take a break but I also didn't want to break my flow.</p>
<p>I bumped into a rider about midnight and we rode for a short while and he explained how it had been the previous year. He had booked a hotel and overslept. He still rode the rest of the route as his car was parked in Leighton Buzzard.</p>
<p>Exeter was just an all-night garage and the chap I had met earlier arrived soon after me. He said he was going to have a 20 minute doze rather than go to a hotel and suffer the previous year's fate. I decided to do the same after eating my sandwich but found it too noisy. Nevertheless it was a good rest and I quietly exited the garage forecourt and went on my way. Perhaps a bus shelter may be better. I really did want to have a sleep especially having woken at 04:15 the previous day and had already experienced some dozing. On the 400km ride that I had ridden in June I had noticed how dozing took away the focus and strength so even though part of me wanted to push on it would be better to sleep a bit and ride faster and fully focused. I saw one ideal bus shelter but it was occupied by someone who seemed more experienced in bus shelter sleeping. I found another one just a little further on and it felt warm enough to lie down on the floor. I set my alarm just in case but the sleep just wouldn't come. Then it started to rain. It was medium to heavy and I was glad to be under cover. I still hadn't opened my eyes but the water splashed onto my face and caused me to turn at first followed by sitting up. I looked at a street lamp to see how heavily it was raining until eventually I could no longer see any movement. It had stopped. I had my space blanket with me but didn't feel like taking it out.</p>
<p>I had borrowed a bivvy bag from another rider but on this occasion as I hadn't enough luggage capacity I hadn't brought it with me. I also would have needed some sort of camping mat as the floor would have been too cold and also too hard. My not so well thought out plan was to simply carry a space blanket with me due to it being light and compact. Rather than having one long sleep at the half-way point my idea was to have two short sleeps: one at 200 and one at 400. I also thought that it may be easier to sleep during the daytime when it was warmer. I could find a warm spot in a field and lie down for an hour. But when I tried this the sun soon disappeared, it coulded over and got breezy. It was still a good plan in theory I thought.</p>
<p>Soon after the rain had stopped and when all I could hear was the occasional drip, a rider rode past at quite a rapid rate. Looking at their attire and luggage I guessed that they were on the ride too. I assumed that they had found somewhere to sleep, possibly at a hotel and had risen refreshed and ready for the 2nd half. Someone who knew how to tackle this distance. Hotels are expensive and staying there for 3-4 hours would have made it even less value for money. But then how refreshed would I have felt having had a shower and 4 hours of sleep? Would that have been worth the money? Perhaps it only cost half if it was only half the night?</p>
<p>Time to move again. I did feel somewhat refreshed and wondered at catching the rider that had passed. It was around 03:00 and around 90km to the next control in Wells. I felt sort of fresh but it didn't last long and soon the bleary eyes came back with some added nausea mixed in with a hint of toothache. It was a dark empty road with a gentle breeze and a wet mist hitting my face. I assumed that the wind would be pushing me now but only sometimes. I took some short breaks to combat the weariness. But the night was short and the dawn arrived quickly. At the first full light of day I found myself in Taunton. Now the head nodding took hold me in earnest and I figured that that was the time to allow myself to actually take a rest and possibly sleep. I saw some benches around a paved area and thought it an ideal spot. A short 20 minute power nap I was sure would see me through for a good long while. This time I actually did sleep rather than doze even though it was short lived. I was awoken by the local refuse collection: the town preparing for a busy Sunday. It was around 05:30.</p>
<p>A couple more hours and passing by Glastonbury I arrived in Wells, the 400km control. I stopped at the first shop that I saw open and asked if it was in Wells. He replied in the affirmative. A bottle of water, a snickers bar and some chocolate coated coconut rings. The all important receipt of course. I loaded up the next route and it went by the cathedral and the college. Even against a backdrop of heavy drizzle it was quite breathtaking.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I chose this route was because I have friends who have a holiday house near Cirencester and even though it was at the 500km mark, it would be nice to see familiar faces, along with a sleep in a real bed, a shower and a warm meal. Another long section of 90km or more before I would get close to Cirencester but the thought of a proper break kept me going. I needed that encouragement because the section of the route from Wells to Cirencester had the toughest climbs of all. Not only long but also steep. They seemed to come one after another and each one sapping my reserve a little more. How many long steep climbs does it take to break someone? But then some people do like hills and go in search of them. I am not one of those people and wondered why they couldn't be moved to a ride with AAA (Audax Altitude Award) points. Even rides that are not marked as hilly or rather not hilly enough to qualify for AAA points can have some tough climbs and organisers like to add in a few which are often termed, "the sting in the tail." I imagined that right now I was experiencing said sting. I stopped at almost every summit for a short break to recover and take note of how depleted I was. But after a drink and snack I was rolling along. The views werr stunning and I took the time to enjoy them. Some of the climbs ended at scenic viewpoints where cars had gathered to enjoy the splendour of the landscape. Sometimes climbs on rides are simply for the sake of climbing but nearly all of these did result with a reward of view that was worthwhile.</p>
<p>A couple of hours later I was in Bath and even though I assumed that I had been there before, when I saw it I realised that I hadn't or at least not as an adult. This really was quite spectacular. The route took us on a short tour through the back streets and main streets. It suddenly became apparent as to what the fuss about Bath was all about: it certainly is a town with a wow factor. Out of Bath into Batheaston to be greeted by very tough climbs. I pushed aside my likes and dislikes and focused on my technique and rhythm: I just needed to reach the top, remain calm and carry on. I had received a text message saying that I had a shower, bed and warm meal waiting for me. God speed. I passed Malmesbury which I recognised from my DIY perm at the end of May. The sun was out and I was getting very close to my 'proper break'.</p>
<p>At one point the speed question came to mind. If rode at such a pace then I would finish at such a time etc. Endless mental calculations to pass the time some of which are actual strategic ones and others merely mental noodling. I was wanting to be finished by such a time and even considered skipping the visit to my friends. Just keep plodding on in my dozy state, finish the ride, get on the train and get home. But that would be throwing away such a great opportunity. Speed, as in being fast doesn't matter in Audax. All that matters is that you can finish inside the very generous time limit. I'm not a fast rider by any means but I have no problem completing a ride inside the allocated time even at my plodding pace. I continued with my mental calculations and came up with when would be the latest I could leave their house if I wanted to finish by 23:00.</p>
<p>Having told my friends that I would arriving by 14:00 due to the tiredness and hills I actually rolled in at just after 13:00. Greetings and congratulations. A sunny seat on the verandah with pitta pieces dipped in taramasalata and my first cup of tea. After a few minutes of snacking and chatting I took a quick shower and got into bed. Straight to sleep as expected and alarm set for 15:30. I thought it would be harder to wake up but not so. Pasta with pesto and soon I was saying my goodbyes. It was still sunny and I wondered what sort of terrain awaited me.</p>
<p>I still had to get my receipt from Cirencester so that was my first port of call. No need for supplies so an ATM receipt would suffice. As soon as I got it and saw that it was almost 17:00 and that I still had 110km to ride and only 6 hours to ride it. I took a large gulp of saliva. If the rest of the route was without hills and I could maintain a steady pace and take minimal breaks then I could make it. But any long breaks or mishaps of any sort would mean that I would not finish in time. The shower, sleep and meal had given me energy and focus, enough I could feel to last me the rest of the ride. Lo and behold the final secion was all long descents on smooth wide roads: perfect. It was as though we were being rewarded for that section of long punishing climbs. The next control was Brackley, 76km away. More time calculations. If I travelled at a speed of 20km/h then it should just before 21:00. But then I should try to move faster than that to create a time buffer. I also should be aware of pushing myself too hard in case I burned out and ended up struggling to keep pace. The long descents meant that I could maintain a high speed with very little effort. Now that I felt focused and rested there was no fear of falling asleep.</p>
<p>The sun continued to shine and lit up the scene with an idyllic timeless hue as though I had leapt into a painted rural landscape. The road and the traffic seemed to merge into the long tall grass as I glided between the hedgerows like a hawk swooping upon its prey. One reason that my lower back had been hurting was due to involuntary spasms during fast descents. Fear. Fear of falling. Fear of hurting or injuring myself. I told my back to relax. I could feel the contraction begin and I encouraged myself to trust the bike and to trust the road and to trust in my own skill. Just like that hawk, you have to let go and let yourself fall and let gravity do its work.</p>
<p>I arrived in Brackley, a pretty market town with a clock above the town hall. 20:36, which was almost half an hour faster than I had anticipated. I had my time buffer. No need to buy food as I had plentiful snacks to see me through to the end which was only 37km away. At the ATM I got a balance of my account and put on my tights and arm warmers. Another rider arrived and asked if I could lead him out of the town into the next section: he had been using the route sheet and had got lost a number of times. This was a rider I had seen earlier and also on my two previous rides; another plodder like myself. But talking to him and waiting for him to purchase and take food used up my buffer. I told him I was anxious to get going and he quickly finished his small meal, from the kebab van parked in the middle of the square.</p>
<p>Within only minutes of leaving Brackley the drizzle came again but this time heavier, much heavier. It grew steadier till it could no longer be called drizzle and caused me to stop and put on my overshoes, gloves, rain jacket and hat. It rained hard for a short while until rivulets trickled across the road and water sprayed up into the beam of my headlamp. I drifted across the road to find the shallowest parts but also pushing on to keep my pace. It didn't matter if I burned myself out now as I was so close to the end. One minute I felt as though I would make it and the next I felt all was lost. But whatever happened I was going home. Either I finished the ride on time or I didn't but I was riding to Leighton Buzzard train station where I would get the train back to London. I had checked the train times and there was one leaving just before 23:00 and the last train was 23:27: I was sure to make that at least.</p>
<p>It grew darker and gradually the rain eased till the road became dry and I was starting to dry off too. In my mind I could see the pretty villages I had passed in the final stages such Bibury, Fairford and Sandford. The route had been a scenic one to the very end. In the last few kilometres I began to doubt if I had taken a wrong turn but I trusted my Garmin and was comforted by signs pointing to the station. On the wall of the ticket office, "Free Cash", which is where I could 'control': something that I had been wondering. 22:46. A rider who I had seen earlier appeared out of the shadows presumably loading his car and now out of his cycling attire said that it had been a hard ride. The rider that I had met in Brackley was nowhere to be seen. But there was no time to wait: the next train to London Euston was departing at 22:53. I lifted my bike and walked over the footbridge to platform 3. It was delayed by 2 minutes; no rush. Perfect timing all in all.</p>
<p>I boarded the rather crowded train. Standing room only or having to sit far away from my bike. No matter. I did stretching exercises and took some snacks. I tried to accept that I had completed a 600km Audax ride. 40 minutes later I was in Euston. It was time for my final ride home. Most other cyclists passed me on the road but they were all oblivious to what I had done and probably wouldn't believe me if I told them. I had just completed my first Super Randonneur series.</p>
