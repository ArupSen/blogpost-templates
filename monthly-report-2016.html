<p>The start of September feels like the end of the summer holidays and getting back to work. I have only just completed the August report having not set any goals and neglected any ongoing reporting. This month I'm keen to get going with my goals and have a clear idea of what I want to achieve this month. I also want to keep a closer eye on what I'm doing and how well I'm progressing through the month. This months report could therefore end up becoming fairly long.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>Continue with the Reddit recommended routine. Focus on better form and dipping into the next level.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Diet</h4>
<p>Try the August approach again: Keeping track with myfitnesspal, follow a meal plan, no snacks but a touch more lenient.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Yoga practice</h4>
<p>Sessions without any screen time so only audio if required such as music, podcasts, audio books or radio. Use a timer for poses, focus on breathing, do an advanced version of Rich's program as he is away during September. Handstands on non-workout days.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing Clutter</h4>
<p>Sell my extra bike parts and throw out any worn out bits in the wheel room.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>Complete 2 x 200 plus rides. The Flatlands 600 is already booked for the 10th. Rollers at least once a week.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming</h4>
<p>Code school mobile design courses to help me build a responsive Racer Rosa website and also my wheelbuilding site.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>Add a third session on top of my current two (or more) per week for 'burst' sessions where the focus is entirely on speed.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>Read 2 books this month and then possibly continue till the end of the year if it works this month. I spend a lot of time on TV, movies and gaming: could I move that time to reading?</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
<p>Get my mentee ready for their solo shift, commitment & SIT2 training. Come up with a fund-raising strategy for the branch in readiness for the financial status of the branch changing on the 1st of October.</p>
<li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
<p>Build a Hackintosh laptop for my housemate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
