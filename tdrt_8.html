<p>Part of me wanted to skip it today but I thought that as I wouldn't be riding it might be a good idea to do it as it was only 15 mins and it would be a great warm up for the strength training. I did a session that was almost identical to yesterday's one i.e. 15 mins with a 30 second faster spin at 10 mins and at 5 mins. To start with I did feel a little shaky and had to touch the walls for balance but there was no associated fear or anxiety but only a sense of surprise. Just shows how quickly my confidence has improved in only a few days. During the first 30 second sprint I was bouncing and found it hard to keep my balance. The second was much steadier and very focused. I did experience little pangs of boredom even in a 15 minute session so I need to add something to hold my interest. I think it's a case of, "Well, I can balance and I can put both hands on the bar; no now what?" As I've been riding fixed then it has to be a cadence counter. But that means spending money and equipment that I may stop using after a short period. The other annoying thing is sweat going into my eyes but I think a tea towel might solve that issue.</p>
