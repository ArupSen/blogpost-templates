<p>September started with some disappointment: the cramped calves and heavy exhaustion which led to my missing the Flatlands 600 and then taking at least 2 weeks till I felt myself again. I didn't ride much at all over the month, not even commuting so when it came to possibly doing a night ride on the 24th I was quite anxious. But heavy rain was forecast for early Sunday morning and during the day on Saturday I was tired. I felt that I should have been riding on Sunday but decided that even though I had missed my chance of getting the Super Fixed Wheeler award, if I got one more 200km ride done before the end of the month (the end of the season), then I would be able to claim the 40@40 (forty at forty) award. This season, the 2015 - 2016 season, being the 40th anniversary of Audax there was a special award given to those who rode 40 points or more. So far I had accumulated 39 points and it would be a real shame if I did not at least attempt it. I got my Samaritans shift covered for Tuesday 27th and then got on to creating a route. I decided to ride a route that I had plotted in 2014 but didn't ride at the time. It was the 160km (actual distance 170km) version of the 100km ride that I ridden with a couple of friends in May. It started from Meopham, which was very familiar, so no surprises. I added the distance from my house to Meopham and back, which gave me a minimum distance of 220km, which was already a good 10% over distance but the actual distance was more like 240km. The thing I had to keep in mind was that the route would only be validated for 200km and therefore the time limit was still 14 hours.</p>
<p>My bike was in good shape as far as I remembered but I hadn't ridden it since the Isle of Wight ride on the 24/25th of August. (I haven't written a report on that one.) I pumped up the tyres and drizzled some oil on the chain. All very last minute on the morning of the ride. I made sure that my GPS device, the Garmin Etrex 20 was set to record the track. Thinking that summer was over, I put on my tights as well as a base layer but later found this to be way too warm. But as my geared bike has minimal storage the option of taking off my tights to cool myself down would have proved to be cumbersome.</p>
<p>Having breakfasted on a couple of sultana scones I set off at 08:15 which put me slap bang into the commuters and the school runners. I imagine that some were doing both. I have ridden from my home to Meopham many times along the same route that I was riding today and it took me the same 1h 45minutes that it always does. I stopped for no more than 5 minutes in Meopham only to eat a muesli bar and change my GPS track from "Home to Meopham" to "Hop Garden 160".</p>
<p>Having worked out all the distances between the controls the previous day for the entry submission I had a good idea of how long it would take me between each one. My plan was to have a short stop at Wye which was at 85km and then a longer break at the halfway point at Hythe. It was busy with traffic in Meopham so I got off the main street as quickly as I could and headed for Sole Street. A narrow road with apple orchards either side. There were pickers with baskets strapped to them steadily removing the very large apples. The densely planted trees were heavily laden and I really wanted to try one. The road was too narrow and too busy to stop. Occasionally fallen fruit had rolled onto the road and I felt the urge to take a bite but the urge to continue onwards was far greater.</p>
<p>My level of fitness seemed similar to what it had been in the summer but due to the lack of training I did notice a drop in strength and I struggled on the ascents, even mild ones. I told myself that I needed to pace myself and used the easy gears when it came to hills. It does slow you down but does conserve a lot of energy. Riding out of the saddle on a bigger gear only allows a fraction of greater speed but at the cost of far greater effort. What if my calves cramped during the ride? What if I suddenly felt exhausted and had to quit? I had to pace myself but not at too slow a pace due to the fact that I was riding 240km in 14 hours.</p>
<p>About 3 hours into the ride having so far stopped perhaps a couple of times totalling no more than 10 minutes, I began to struggle both physically and mentally. It was a feeling that I had had during a night ride when the mixture of sleepiness and fatigue combine to result in a pace that was so slow it needed attention. There was a sense of disbelief that my fitness could have dropped so low. There was also a strong sense of boredom: why another ride; hadn't I ridden enough this year? I listened to these physical and mental protests when I passed a perfect spot to take a break in Harrietsham. I initially told myself to push on to Wye but only 200m or so after a little shop I stopped and turned back. The extra clothing combined with hazy sunshine left me sweating as though it were a summer day. I bought a sausage roll, ginger beer and a bottle of water then sat down on a bench on the little green across the road from the shop. I was riding along and therefore wasn't required to stop at the designated checkpoints. Right now was when I needed a break. I was so glad that I did. Having had bouts of exhaustion all through the month and having done no training or riding and having fasted the previous day I should have expected such an episode during the ride. I had also performed many squats on Sunday in lieu of my ride which made my legs feel a bit sore and heavy. I put my disbelief to one side and accepted reality. I was dealing with the physical symptoms by resting and eating and while I sat on the bench I began to deal with the mental.</p>
<p>It was a fairly pleasant day for late September and turning back now would save me perhaps 4 hours. But the planned route of my ride was home: whether I went home now or whether I continued on to Hythe I would eventually end up at home. If I didn't finish the ride I would get no points and my attempt at getting those final points to achieve the 40@40 would have been in vain. That was the reason I was riding today and I had to admit that part of me was enjoying it too. The pace I was going was not as fast as my normal pace but still more than ample to be inside the time limit. I was also looking forward to a sit down meal at Hythe. Once I felt refreshed, I rode on.</p>
<p>The road to Harrietsham to Wye was up and down and the inclines severely sapped my speed but I could feel the energy and the enthusiasm slowly return as I recognised familiar routes and gave them a knowing nod. I imagined how the layout of these small towns and villages hadn't changed for a few hundred years. I didn't stop in Wye having already stopped earlier in Harrietsham and I arrived there around 13:30, which was just a little later than I would have predicted. There was more climbing out of Wye on the way to Hythe and I arrived at the Light Railway Cafe at 14:45.</p>
<p>I had had 14:00 in mind which having left at 08:00 was 6 hours later. 120km in 6 hours was an average of 20km per hour. But I was going slower than that. I was just pleased that I had made it in spite of my bouts of doubt and lack of energy. The Light Railway Cafe in Hythe has been a control for many Kent Audaxes I have ridden including Wye Wednesday, the Hop Garden 200, the Fairies Flattest 300 and the Oasts and Coasts. It was a welcome sight but without the rabble of riders and the controller stamping cards. The place was almost deserted. The service was very fast and within minutes of sitting down I was looking at a plate of sausage, egg and chips along with a mug of tea. As I looked out of the window and squeezed HP Sauce onto my plate I half expected other riders to arrive but none came. This meal, at this destination, had driven me on and was every bit as good as I had expected, although at &pound;7.50, a little on the expensive side. Having finished my plate I thought about dessert and noticed some jam doughnuts under a glass dome. I figured they would be dry by now but bought one anyway. It was indeed dry but the jam tasted good and my body would use the calories irrespective of moisture content.</p>
<p>At 15:20 I was on my way again but feeling very bloated. It was painful and the road out of Hythe was a long and busy incline. It really wouldn't do to stop now as I had only just taken a rest stop so I angled my body as best I could to manage the pain. Having reached the top of the hill and almost missed a turn I tried to calculate how long it would take me to reach Staplehurst, the next checkpoint, 45km away. The sky clouded over and drizzle started. It was actually rather welcome and cooled me down. But the road was now relatively flat and I was able to maintain a steady pace. The bloated feeling took more than an hour to subside but it was not too significant and certainly not debilitating. The boredom and sense of meaninglessness gradually took hold of me but as my goals coincided all I needed to do was to keep pedalling: I wanted to be at home and I needed to ride home. I wanted to push myself to ride just a little faster in order that I would be home at an earlier hour. If I could add just a fraction more effort especially on flat sections without any sense of overexertion which might leave me tired later on during the ride, then the aggregation of those small gains might get me home a lot faster. What I found to be the case though was that fraction of perceived effort took my speed up a lot higher than expected. If I happened to be travelling at say 21km/h without that extra effort then after applying it I found that I would be moving at 25km/h and holding it at that pace. When there was an incline or a headwind I dropped the effort. What I also found was that I was able to hold the pace for longer bursts than I had anticipated and was also able to hold a tuck position by putting my hands on the drops rather than the brake hoods. I was pretty sure that I had ridden into a headwind on the outward journey and now the Southerly wind was pushing me home. It certainly was a much faster route because I was home a whole hour faster than it had taken me to get to Hythe.</p>
<p>I didn't stop in Staplehurst but mentally checked it off. It was on a hill and although a picturesque village, very busy. I was also enjoying my new found energy, focus and speed. I was comfortable and also had my mojo back. I saw a cyclist exiting a shop and thought that perhaps it would be good for me to stop somewhere soon. I had emptied one bottle and being extra warm I was drinking more than I usually did. I have a 500ml bottle and a 750ml bottle. I usually refill the 500ml bottle and rarely move the larger one especially as I keep it in the less accessible cage. But I was working my way through it and noticed that it was rattling and that replacing it back into its cage was harder than expected. When I reached West Malling upon examination I noticed that it had actually broken but only on one side. From the Tesco in West Malling I got a 500ml bottle of water along with a Snickers bar and a small bottle of apple juice. I had been craving some fruit and this was a good compromise. I was still feeling energetic and not too hungry but glad that I had stopped for a short break.</p>
<p>Meopham was very close but I mentally prepared myself for Holly Hill: a long steep climb providing the 'sting in the tail' that apply to most Audax rides. As this was my own route I could quite easily have re-routed another way avoiding the climb but as it was a flat course overall I had decided to leave it in. It was dark when I arrived especially under the shade of trees and cars passed in both directions along the narrow slope. I spun my easiest gear and decided to adopt a 'no heroics' strategy. I even rested at the summit. Soon I would be in Meopham followed by a fast ride home.</p>
<p>The route back from Meopham follows partly the outward route for about 5km but then B-roads and back streets in favour of lanes. This makes it a few km longer but a more pleasant route at night. The first 10km is one long steady descent and the rest is very familiar. At 21:15 I walked through my front door, around 13 hours after I had exited.</p>
<p>I felt in good spirits but declined to check my GPS track log till the next day. In fact I didn't check it till the day after that. My energy dropped rapidly and having stretched and showered I felt faint and nauseous while I prepared a meal. My plans to watch a movie and spend time doing various other things soon evaporated. I had to sit down till the nausea had passed and then finished my meal. I took myself straight off to bed.</p>
<p>A few days later I extracted my track log from my Etrex 20 and submitted it. The day after that it showed as validated: my 40@40 goal had been achieved. More relief than elation and I look forward to receiving the medal which I will place in a drawer and forget. But the memories of all these rides in 2015-2016 season will always be with me.</p>
