<p>This was the first ride of any kind since the 300 on Sunday with today being Tuesday. It was also only the 2nd time that I have ridden the geared bike. My plan was to do what is called "Active Recovery" by riding at a very gentle pace. I didn't really feel much like riding which showed that I wasn't yet fully recovered and I was also starting to get a cold. It was after 10pm when I reluctantly mounted the bike. I was all over the place and found it difficult to keep the bike straight. Quite a shock and very different to my fast high powered experience on Thursday evening. I didn't set the timer and didn't change gear much and tried to spin as best I could. At one point I selected a very low gear but found it very hard to control the bike at that rapid cadence. I changed back up. Without a timer I simply continued until I had had enough.</p>
