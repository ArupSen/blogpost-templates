<p>One of my goals this year was to ride or rather complete an SR Series. An SR or Super Randonneur is a series of 200, 300, 400 and 600km rides that have to be completed in the same season. Last year I rode my first 300km event and this year in June I rode my first 400km event and looking at the Audax calendar the Buzzard, starting from Leighton Buzzard was the most convenient starting point for me.</p>
<p>The start time was 07:00 on Saturday 9th July and also an X-rated event. That meant no manned controls (checkpoints) and only someone handing out brevet cards at the start: you had to be totally self-reliant i.e. more like a solo ride. I have ridden a good number of perms (non-calendar solo events) and the 400km event that I rode a couple of months ago was also X-rated so I felt comfortable with this prospect.</p>
<p>I arrived at Leighton Buzzard train station at 07:09. The station was the starting / ending point and I decided against getting the earlier train out of London Euston which would have got me in at 06:34: why hang around in a train station car park? I got up at 04:15 and even though my daughter had stayed over I managed not to wake her during my early morning preparations. As per usual I ate 3 rounds of toast (peanut butter and marmalade a la Graham Obree) and one to take with me. I filled my bottles and donned my bike wear. Tights, gloves and arm warmers which would later need to be removed.</p>
<p>I set off at 05:15 for a quiet backstreet ride through London courtesy of <a href="http://cyclestreets.net">cyclestreets.net</a> and arrived with a good 10 minutes to purchase my return ticket at London Euston. &pound;29.10 for a 40 minute ride does seem a lot to me. Must cost commuters a fortune and be a big chunk of their regular costs. It niggled me a little but as this was my first attempt at this distance I didn't want to ride to the start.</p>
<p>One of the things that I had fussed over during the week was luggage. I don't have any problems with this on the fixie as that has a rack and pannier i.e. ample luggage capacity. But my geared racer only has the Ortleib saddle bag which is usually more than half full with only an emergency kit: where would I put my tights, gloves and arm warmers when the sun came out? At first I considered a handlebar bag but there were too many options and due to the short head tube my front light would have been obscured. I also considered getting some other larger saddle bag such as those made by Apidura for bikepackers who like to ride lightweight, but these items are expensive and I am not sure if I want to ride other such events that require sleep stops, so I decided to improvise. My solution was two plastic carrier bags one inside the other to create strength and waterproofing strapped on top of the Ortleib bag in a fat sausage shape and secured with a bungee cord. This actually worked really well except when I loaded it too heavily (with food) and the mounting of the Ortleib bag failed and the whole thing landed on the rear wheel. Aside from a space blanket I didn't pack any sleeping gear as this was new to me and again there was no space for it.</p>
<p>Having arrived at 07:09 I got out of the station on the wrong side and had to go over the footbridge to find the car with the open hatch in the car park. I got my brevet card and a couple of snack bars. I told them that it was my first 600 and they said they had ridden their first the previous year. It was around 07:20 and ticking but these two seemed to want to chat not seeing how anxious I was to get started.</p>
<p>I had the file for the first section already loaded on my Garmin Etrex 20 and as always followed the thick purple line out of the station and into a village called Wing. The organiser had broken up the route or track into 9 separate .gpx files. What I have done in the past is to mark the info or manned controls on the track as waypoints. But as there is no warning to inform you (or I haven't figured out how to do it), I calculate the distances between each control and start paying attention when I am close to that number.It seems obvious now but making the ride a sequence of shorter rides makes it a lot more straight forward. I think I may adopt this strategy on future rides. I wouldn't be spending my thinking time calculating how far it was to the next control or missing an info control. This would also be useful when tracks crossed over such as clover leaf or figure of eight shapes.</p>
<p>The first section was from Leighton Buzzard to Pangbourne. I have been on many rides where Pangbourne was the control so it was a very familiar place. It was 67km away. It was cloudy but warm and I felt at the back of the field having started late. I had noticed two other riders next to their cars still getting ready but I figured they would pass me at some stage. Sure enough within the next hour that was what happened. The route was gently rolling with not much climbing passing through the Chilterns via Chinnor, Watlington, Nuffield and Wallingford.</p>
<p>I don't like to stop at cafes unless I'm riding with someone and even then I am anxious to get going. I prefer to have more numberous but shorter stops rather than longer breaks. At Pangbourne I got snacks and drinks at the supermarket to earn my Proof of Passage receipt. I didn't want to remain 'in town' to take my meal and loaded up my lunch or rather elevenses atop my saddle bag to eat it at a quiet spot in the countryside. Even though I had planned to stop at the first opportunity I didn't find a spot that I liked till about an hour later. There was a section that was along a busy A4 so I didn't want to stop next to busy traffic. Soon the route turned off the main road and a little after a railway level crossing I had found my spot. Kingsclere I recognised from the Willy Warmer ride in January but now going the opposite way. I guess organisers borrow from each other. But this time the route was going South West into Hampshire. The next control was Chandlers Ford a little further South of Winchester, but it took us on a quick tour of Winchester itself rather than totally bypassing it. Just long enough to soak it in. At this point I caught up with a rider that I recognised from two previous Audax rides.</p>
<p>Another Co-op in Chandlers Ford with a row of bike parking racks outside and half a dozen riders snacking and refilling their bottles. There were nods of acknowledgement but no conversation. Local teenagers on BMXs milling about and wondering at the cyclists and pretending to ignore them. I noticed bicycles parked across the road at a cafe but as I've mentioned, it's not my thing when riding solo.</p>
<p>Next was due West to Salisbury. Only 34km. I stopped somewhere en route to eat my lunch which was essentially a big snack as I was snacking all the while at each pit (piss) stop. As Salisbury was so close I didn't buy any food except for a packet of crisps and a drink but on the way I noticed that my luggage solution wasn't really working and that I couldn't load it too heavily or the bracket would collapse and the whole thing would fall on the tyre. I had a bag of dried dates which I put into my jersey pocket and that seemed to do it.</p>
<p>The next section was to Sherborne. Some long pleasant stretches of the A30 and once again heading South West. Some headwinds.Some drizzle. What made my pack heavy were the tights and gloves so it was time to put them on again. The GPS track ended outside a pub and two riders that I had passed climbing a hill into a headwind. The drizzle and headwinds had already sapped my spirits a little and I could also feel the onset of toothache. But seeing these two stop outside the pub really made my heart sink. I saw two other bikes parked outside and not having seen any other shops open other than a pizza place and a kebab place I decided to investigate a sign I'm sure I had seen saying town centre. I found a Waitrose tucked away which was open till 9.00pm. Phew. I hate pubs especially on my own. A bottle of water, a cornish pastie, an addition of layers of clothing and a brief conversation with other riders also 'controlling' at the Waitrose before I set off again.</p>
