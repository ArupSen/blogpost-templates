<p>Having ridden my first 300 in April 2015 and getting comfortable at the 200 I thought I would have a go at another 300. When I first saw it on the audax calendar I wondered if it would fit into my calendar espcially as I am doing the Samaritans Initial Training at the moment but the timing was perfect. I also wanted to ride it fixed gear especially as the route was flat but was concerned about doing it on my temporary bike due to my Racer Rosa bike not being ready in time.</p>
<p>The ride was from Bethersden near Ashford and started at 02:00 on a Sunday which is effectively Saturday night and that meant it would be no problem getting a train. It's usually quite difficult to get a train early on a Sunday morning so I was pleased by this.</p>
<p>I had booked it well in advance and had received the email about the route and logistics. I had assumed that the message contained a downloadable .gpx file so had left it all till the last minute. I read the message properly at Saturday lunchtime and found that it only contained a route sheet, which meant that if I wanted a .gpx file I would have to create my own and that meant also that I had no time to waste. I had also wanted to take a nap so time was of the essence. In addition to this I needed to create routes to the station. It took me the better part of 3 hours and I also managed to sleep a good long time from 3-6 pm. I felt ready.</p>
<p>I ate a large bowl of pasta and having already moved my saddle bag the previous day I proceeded to do a little yoga at 10pm. I would get the train from Orpington to Pluckley and the ride would take an hour according to my usual speed. I allowed more time but even though I pootled along I arrived early. Very little traffic. Ample time to buy a ticket but the machine was out of order. I wandered around outside the station as I was worried but then decided to stand on the platform as the barrier was open. I met another rider on the platform but after exchanging our hellos no conversation ensued. At 00:06 the train arrived. I waited for the conductor to ask for my ticket and offer to pay but he simply walked by.</p>
<p>Pluckley is one of those tiny country stations so I had travelled without paying a fare. Fair enough. The ride to the village hall took all of 15 minutes and I was warmly greeted. There were around 40 riders for the 300 and many had travelled by car. It was only just after 01:00 so there was plenty of time. Tea and biscuits and a few hellos.</p>
<p>The route was a 100km loop back to the start all on main roads which are of course deserted at night. When I saw this in the email I had my doubts but when we rode it I thought it made total sense. Empty roads, good surfaces and also wide with easy turns. A few very minor climbs but there was a bit of a Westerly breeze. I managed to stay with the leading group for a good while but soon got dropped. No matter. I didn't want to burn out in the early stages. We traversed a sleepy Kent coast riding to Folkestone and returning alongside the sea wall. The halfway control was in a car park next to the sea wall and climbing the steps I could see the sea. The sun was just starting to rise and leaving the control we were into the Romney Marshes. The area is so flat it's ideal for riding fixed gear and the views were spectacular with the first rays of sunlight. It was a warm night and I had to remove my soft shell jacket. I was back at the hall around 06:15 which is probably as fast as I have ever ridden 100km. A hearty bacon sandwich and a good amount of biscuits was consumed. Half an hour later at 06:45 I started on the 200.</p>
