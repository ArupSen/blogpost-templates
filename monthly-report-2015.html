<p>The start of April and I'm not really with it due to finishing the end of last month spending time in bed ill and now gradually recovering. It's also Easter time and the days that I take Maya have changed or rather that I'm not seeing her over the Easter weekend which again makes things appear odd as seeing Maya is such a regular feature in my life. But in that sense it's a break, a time to stop and reflect.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>The first week has been a recovery week with zero on the first day, then a cut down session on the 2nd and then sub-maximal on the third i.e. not able to reach the rep counts that I have been reaching recently. Shows how hard the illness hit me.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>During the few days of my illness I practiced yoga in bed which I thought was commendable given my general lack of energy. This shows that I am indeed motivated.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p>Two old rims sawed up and binned today. They had been sitting around and watching me for a long time. I had laced them to check if they could be re-used but both were beyond that point.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p>Been looking at the courses on the Pragmatic Studio website. They look very similar to the Code School courses in that they have instructional video lectures followed by accompanying exercises. However, they are a lot more expensive compared to Code School. Not entirely outside of my price range, however I wouldn't want to pay the price and then find I lose motivation or time. The focus is mainly on Ruby and Rails. In some ways I'm excited about Ruby since doing the Programming Languages course and understanding it's functional side but it also feels like a throwback to 2009 when I first got on this home study of programming trying to learn Ruby and Rails. Perhaps six years on it will come more easily and also be more rewarding especially as the technology has matured a lot and my general programming knowledge and skills have improved a great deal too.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I've started reading The Time Machine by H G Wells and since it is a short work I think that I should be able to complete it well inside the month time frame and also complete my other choice of Three Men in a Boat. I think I have already mentioned these books in my previous report but I'm excited at the thought of actually catching up to my one book a month goal. Of the ones that have been lacking this is really picking up again and I hope to do some audio book recording his month too.</p>
