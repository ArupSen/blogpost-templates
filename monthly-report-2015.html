<p>We start August, today being the 3rd, with a change of focus. The first half of the year has been very much about cycling and Audax and that will of course continue till the end of the year but now that the Samaritans Initial Training is complete I can now focus on the Programming Training. It feels like I had a month off in July so time to get back to work. Taking it easy was kind of the plan and as well as getting into my studies again I also need to start looking for work to cover the loss of income from giving up my regular Tuesday lunchtime yoga class.</p>
<p>Getting close to the end of the month it being the 24th today and I haven't been updating very much this month at all. I'm going to write a little today but realise that means I will have lost the freshness with some things. No matter, it's good to be able to write when I have the urge and with still a week to spare.</p>
<p>It's the very last day of August, the 31st and the last Bank Holiday Monday of the year. As a freelancer it's not significant to me as such but it sort of marks the end of the UK summer calendar and heralds a kind of "back to work" and the move into autumn. In terms of performance I think I've done rather well this month especially as I've managed to start up my programming efforts once more which I've been really enjoying.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>Having thought last month about pure strength and adding extra weight to my usual bodyweight exercises I seem to have changed tack and am focusing more on volume again after working out with Greg and following the advice given in the YouTube videos he has sent me about Calisthenics workouts. I tried out one of these today and did 50 pull-ups in total but didn't feel as taxed as I thought I would.</p>
<p>After a week of this new regime I did feel very tired which affected everything else that I do. The length of the session has also increased from around 25 minutes to now 45 minutes. Feels good though to be able to perform this many repetitions and thinking back to a time when I couldn't do any pull-ups at all.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p>Following my concerns about overdoing the junk food intake I am looking at ways to generally reduce consumption. Even though I am eating only five days a week due to the other two being fast days I still manage to overeat. Shopping at the market vegetables are really cheap and I don't seem to eat much fruit so I need to gradually introduce or re-introduce vegetables into my diet but without putting pressure on myself to cut down or cut out the bad stuff. Now that I've reached my target weight it's more about keeping it there and consuming foods that contain more nutrition rather than tasty sugar, fat and salt. This should be interesting.</p>
<p>Since July this year I noticed that my weight loss not only plateaued but even went the other way and having bottomed out at 57kg I was creeping back up to 59kg. I told myself that this was muscle mass but also noticed that my bodyfat as viewed in the mirror in terms of the underlying muscle being visible had increased: my sixpack was looking decidedly smooth. I compromised in my belief about muscle mass and told myself that it was half and half. But there is still loose skin around my waist which really bothers me and even though having read up on the subject the main advice given is to be patient I also am in denial about the fact that eating less than healthily on the days that I'm not fasting has no effect. Sometimes I eat handfuls of chocolate bars, large packets of crisps and hardly a whisper of a vegetable manages to pass my lips. During the 2nd week of August from the 16th to the 22nd I had 3 fasting days instead of my usual 2 and also ate more sensibly on the eating days. I don't want to cut out the treats completely (even though part of me would like that) but ate more vegetables. I also ate a little less. On some days the whole days food would consist entirely of treats. This is great fun psychologically and no problem on special days such as birthdays but not as an everyday thing. This really isn't good nutrition.</p>
<p>Going forward then I will need to use this strategy to manage my diet when there are warning signs but in general I just need to cut back just a little on the treats and increase the veg. I think we can say that the party is over in terms of overindulgence.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>Still feel that I should have some sort of routine or program. The freeform or organic way is working pretty well but now that I am teaching very little I am unable to rely on it as part of my practice.</p>
<p>I can't quite recall if it was this month or last but there was one session where I followed a modified but not dissimilar routine that is followed by one of my students but using a timer for a 2 minute count to remain in the postures. I was getting a bit frustrated with the freeform session and also that I seem to be focused again on watching something. I have been watching the whole 5 seasons of the TV series Breaking Bad and using the yoga session to watch while I stretch. It's not as focused as I would like but then sometimes I have watched to episodes back to back making for an hour and a half session. But I really do need to go back to podcasts or radio shows so that I can simply listen rather than watch.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p>I didn't do very well with this in July and it was on my mind a lot. More stuff does keep coming in and I live in a flat where it can look as though I don't have a lot but there is still so much that could be discarded. I think I have to bite the bullet and chuck it. As with some of the other things though such as yoga and diet, it's a question of getting into the habit and then keeping that habit up.</p>
<p>I managed to throw out a rug and even that was done in a reluctant way. I am determined to discard something big before the month is out.</p>
<p>In the final week I didn't really manage to throw anything out, not even a scrap of paper and feel a little disappointed with myself about it but having done so well on my other goals I am not beating myself up too much about it.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>I am slightly going off the boil in terms of riding. I mean not totally but the verve that I had at the start of the year has certainly gone and I don't feel quite as motivated. I still have five 200's to ride and I really just want to tick them off so I don't feel under pressure to complete my twelve. But it has provided good discipline and I think in general it's a good way to keep ones fitness up.</p>
<p>I was planning to have a little bit of a break from the riding and focus a bit more on relaxing this month and to that extent booked a ride in the middle of the month on the 15th. It was a 300km ride so I thought I had better do a little bit of training. I hadn't covered any distance for around 3 weeks so thought it would be in my interest to stay topped up fitness wise. On the 12th I took a ride to Tonbridge in Kent which was just under 90km as a round trip. I had quite a few things to do that day but this fitted in very nicely. It was a lovely day and I had also never been to Tonbridge before. The route itself was a bit hillier than expected but that was a good thing because I knew that the forthcoming ride would be a hilly one. I was hoping to just take one break which would take place in Tonbridge itself but found that about an hour into the ride I felt a little weak and dizzy. A short break and a snack and I was feeling back on form. There was also a small amount of knee pain which also caused some worry but I was sure that it would pass in time for the ride. The other reason I had chosen to ride to Tonbridge was because there are some DIY Perm Audax rides that I'm interested in riding at some point which begin at Tonbridge so this was also a distance and route testing ride. Tonbridge itself, at least what I saw of it was very pretty with a castle and a river and quaint shops. When I arrived it was just after 16:00 so it was quite busy. I sat by the river and took a phone call then returned home.</p>
<p>The main ride this month was called the Around Weald Odyssey which was organised by William Weir who also organised the first ever Audax that I had ridden. I have written a separate more detailed account of the ride but it was more like a DIY in that you had to collect receipts at the controls and I failed to collect the final one at the start / finish control in Redhill. There were no shops open and I had no ATM card to obtain a receipt that way. I have appealed to the organiser who has appealed to the validation secretary on my behalf but it might mean that I will need to complete another ride before the month is over if I am to continue with my RRtY challenge. I did think about doing that today, the 24th, but having seen that there was heavy rain forecast all day I changed my mind. I'm not that dedicated, yet.</p>
<p>On Friday 28th of August I rode the Boat Trip Perm. Very much the same as last month, a 200km Audax ride starting from Hillingdon / Uxbridge going up to Stoke Bruerne and back. From my house to Hillingdon is about 30km. It was a nice day but I wasn't in the mood to ride but I did it anyway all in the name of RRtY because I've started so I'll finish. I haven't yet checked my Garmin to see if the GPS track has recorded but I'm hoping that this will count as my August randonneur ride.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p>I have a plan, which is to work my through the "Functional Javascript" book. Towards the end of July I was watching a few videos about Javascript and also about functional programming, both in Javascript and other languages so it seems that is where my current interest lies. Best to stick with whatever naturally enthuses me rather than studying something which I think would be a good idea or would perhaps be useful in a future career. The other part of the plan is to clock up at least ten hours a week either by hours scattered throughout the week or by having a "Programming Day" every week. I am hoping to do this for the rest of the year but to start with it'll be a 4-6 week course and I should work my way through this book without interruption.</p>
<p>Having decided that I'm going to make a start with the programming and also decided what to study I have an idea for making money. So I'm already distracted and jumping ship. It's an extended spoke calculator where you can save your data and go back to it. Free and paid options with the paid service offering full access. If I can get a load of subscribers then I get a regular monthly income which means that I won't really need to work as such aside from a bit of maintenance and promotion.</p>
<p>I used my newly acquired skills as a Samaritan listener to focus on my feelings about my programming studies and look at why I have been following this pattern of learning in fits and bursts rather than more consistently. I am very interested in the subject but seem to leave it for long periods before I am on the learning trail again. The thing I found was sort of obvious but something I hadn't expected would have such a strong impact. I don't enjoy the pressure and deadlines of the website work. The clients don't care about what I'm doing in that they aren't at all interested. They want the work done, they want it done quickly and they more often than not want to bring down the price. I am unable to share what I love with them and that frustrates me and I don't feel valued. It makes me feel that if I learn and study the subject then I will be subjected to more of this suffering. I do have a plan to get more steady work with websites and programming. But what I feel is that if I am going to be paid well but keep receiving this sort of treatment then why should I bother? I don't want to learn any more if that is what is in store. The solution then would be to separate the two. Tease apart the learning and the career. I can find work another way, perhaps train as an accountant and keep the programming as a hobby with no pressure to use those skills for work. This has had an immediate effect and I seem to have jumped back into studying again. I am focusing on what I'm interested in right this minute rather what might be good to study or what is current or a sought after skill. I want this to be fun, interesting and engaging without any pressure at all. More like entertainment than an obligation. Having had this talk with myself has achieved that. It's so great I've been able to get to the bottom of it. Right now I'm all about Regular Expressions.</p>
<p>In the final week I have finished the Regex course on Code School, completed a short command line course on Codecademy and have been using my newly acquired Regex skills to solve challenges on Code Eval. I seem to be using Javascript again and as far as possible using a functional approach. It's good to have renewed by Code School subscription.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>I stopped doing this due to the roller training but didn't complete my 30 days and now I'm using that as an excuse to avoid it. I have renewed my subscription to Type Scout so I have no excuse.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>Starting the month with another Lee Child novel featuring Jack Reacher called "Worth Dying For" which picks up where the last one ended.</p>
<p>I've finished the novel I've mentioned above and am now wondering about the next one. Will probably be another Jack Reacher. As I've mentioned before, part of me thinks it a bit low brow but at least I am reading and looking forward to it too.</p>
<p>In the final week I downloaded The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne. I have only read a handful of pages and am already finding it hard work after spending the past couple of months reading Lee Child. Let's see how it goes.</p>
