<p>Felt so routine today. Another late one and I would have forgotten if my lodger hadn't mentioned it. I did "rev outs" at 16, 10 and 5 mins. For some reason when I saw 16 I read 4.00pm which I took to mean that I had missed the 5 so I just went for it. I pushed harder than I did yesterday and came very close to falling off the rollers at one point. Great fun and I really enjoyed it. I'm wondering about doing a longer session at some point, perhaps 30 mins.</p>
