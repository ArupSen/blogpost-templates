<p>Got home from a full day of Samaritans training and knew that Maya would be on her way over and thought it would be good to get on the rollers immediately in case she arrived soon. Another instance of getting on them straight after being out on the road. I was quite reluctant and really wanted to put my feet up but decided to do it. 15 minutes isn't long and even it was simply a case of going through the motions it would still have been worth it for the sake of continuity. I was already warmed up from my ride so I got set up and got rolling. I placed a towel on my head to catch the drops of sweat but I didn't fix it there in any way and after a few minutes it fell off. I was fairly steady and after the first 5 minutes I was quite enjoying it and glad that I had got on there. I did the faster spin at 10 mins and 5 mins again, as I did yesterday, for 30 secs each time and could feel the rear wheel sway as I did so but it didn't scare me. Would be good to see my cadence.</p>
