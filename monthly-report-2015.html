<p>It's May, it's the start of May and I didn't see it coming. I've been pretty engrossed with April and forgot that it was only 30 days long rather than 31.</p>
<p>It's now the 6th of May which means a week has almost passed and I'm feeling behind. I am feeling that I am already in catch up mode and that it will take me probably till the end of the month till I have actually caught up. Last night I went to the Samaritans information evening and even though it was interesting and inspiring they do require a good amount hours of commitment and given the amount of stuff that I want to get done this year I wonder if I will find the time and end up getting nothing at all done. In spite of the slight anxiety I am feeling somewhat confident and positive. Not sure where that is coming from but it's there.</p>
<p>It's the 12th of May and this month's 200 ride is done. That means I can get on with wheel building and website building work which has been building up steadily. I have a plan to try and get the website work out of the way by the end of May and it looks as though if I do focus then I could actually do it. The wheel clients on the other hand are fairly laid back so if things become a little bit delayed then they don't mind too much. I've also had another new plan / idea which I'm really excited about and is sort of medium to long term. I call it "Long Weekend Every Weekend". If I can pack my working hours for all the paid work that I do into three days i.e. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday then my weekend can start on Friday and end on Monday evening a bit like an Easter weekend. I've done some initial calculations and given that I can live quite frugally I think it's a possibility. I think it will help me to keep the work and leisure days separate and rather than having every day as a hybrid work / leisure day it may be mentally / psychologically easier to dedicate one day to one thing. It may even make it easier for me to fully embrace the Reading or Programming day which I find difficult at the moment.</p>
<p>I seem to be getting things done in terms of my goals but seem to have lost a sense of structure. I haven't been logging my hours or have a real sense of the specifics of my goals as I did at the start of the year. Things have been sort of more organic which isn't entirely a bad thing especially as things are getting done and I still feel committed; it just feels very different to how I expect my life to feel. There is still an underlying sense of confidence and generally less of a long term undercurrent of worry or fear that I will lose touch with my aims. I suppose I am learning to trust myself and that means letting go to the usual form and structure that I'm used to. But if I can trust myself and trust that I will accomplish my goals then it is a very good thing indeed but it does feel alien and a bit wrong.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>Having missed Wednesday (today being Friday 1st May) due to working on websites I was looking forward to pushing as hard as I could and also adopting some new ideas into my routine. As it has been going so well this year I've been thinking about taking it a step forwards but also cautious that I don't push too far ahead and lose what I've gained by hitting a wall. I have a <a href="https://github.com/ArupSen/workout" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> for my ongoing workout and today I updated it with a small change. The exercises are much the same as I've been doing for the past few months but I changed the order: I did the hardest ones first and the easiest last. I focused on good form: quality rather than quantity even though the mark of progress is increasing the rep count. In the final set I also do a few negatively emphasised reps to push myself to a deeper level of fatigue in the particular muscle groups involved.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p>The 5:2 continues but I am not eating terribly healthily for those 5 days. Cakes, chocolates, a fair amount of grease and very few vegetables. I have bought a small food processor in order to make my own hummus. It allows me to make small amounts and I can dip crudités into them. Well, perhaps I am eating in a healthy way in spite of my consumption of highly processed foods and too much grease. Let's see how long this reign of junk food actually lasts. Perhaps it will be guacamole next. I have also been eating rather a lot of cheese. Perhaps hardly any by some people's standards but being one who only eats Stilton at Christmas time I am sampling a new cheese each week. The blue cheeses are still my favourite. But with at least 35% saturated fat they are rather unhealthy.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>So far this year I've been trying to make progress as well as maintain my level. I certainly have been doing it pretty much every day but there has also been a tinge of disappointment due to the lack of structure and real progress in the same way that I've been enjoying with my cycling or strength training. But the difference is that with those I've been actively working on the progress side of things for the past 2 years or so. The progress orientation is already in place and is an entrenched habit. Not so with yoga and even though I have a rough plan to do more backbends and some other postures that I want to work on this year, when I actually do my practice I find myself doing whatever comes to mind and then feeling that I'm not doing what I ought or that I'm simply wasting my time, especially as I am distracted by watching something while I practice. Listening to something would be better but either way it's a distraction. So it seems that I just want to go through the motions, maintain my level and use it as a time to switch off. What I've decided to do this month then is to practice in a more organic or intuitive way and have no particular goal other than to get on the mat. There is no minimum or maximum duration of the practice time nor are there any particular postures that I need to work on nor is there any stipulation of the level of intensity. I have been questions all of the above and thinking that I need to push harder, longer and work on certain postures. Removing that requirement and lack of clarity allows me to simply feel what should come next, how long to hold it and how hard to push. It will teach me to trust myself and the depth of experience that I have gained from many years of practising yoga and also teaching it professionally. Allowing myself to feel what I should be doing rather than trying to formulate any sort of plan will get me to tap into myself and the teacher that my students respond to.</p>
<p>Well even though I was getting inspired during the 1st week of the month, in the 2nd week I missed a few sessions mainly due to leaving it too late. It was a shame to miss it on the day of the Audax (well, I did a few short minutes) but also the very next day when I did very little all day.</p>
<p>I've missed a few in the 3rd week too. Boo.</p>
<p>Through one thing and another I have missed yoga on many occasions this month. Even though I have been enjoying it due to my new intuitive way of doing things. But I believe this to be a temporary thing and I will pick up with the yoga again very soon.</p>
<p>On the work side I have been pondering the idea of giving up one of my classes. The decision has been an ongoing one for the better part of two years but I have not come to any conclusions. But as the recent pressure of work and other activities have been forcing me to think about what it is I could curtail I have been thinking more seriously about quitting one of my classes at the Peak.</p>
<p>I have written out a list of Plus and Minus points using Edward de Bono's PMI technique and it weighs heavily towards quitting the class. At first I was thinking that I would have to quit both classes but the one on Thursday is sort of coupled with the private one that I teach immediately afterwards so I really should keep that one. But the one on Tuesday costs me a lot of time as well as hanging around time when I have a private class afterwards in the evening. I cannot generally continue with what I was doing when I get home so in a sense the whole day gets used up for that one class. Now that I am committing myself to the Samaritans it will be even more of a push to teach on that day. The only downsides I can see are a slight loss of income and lack of hours on the bike. But the main worry is that I won't use the time for study or for looking for a programming job but waste it on various leisure activities. I think I should take the salary hit and risk it. Perhaps for a few weeks I would use the day purely for leisure but hopefully that wouldn't last long and soon I would start to do more study and job searching. The class pays &pound;45.00, so that is all that I would need to cover from a regular programming job.</p>
<p>I missed a few more sessions towards the very end of the month. Pressure to get other things done and generally too many things on the go so I think that losing that class on Tuesdays will help.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p>I had pile of clothes which I had set aside as pending but that was almost a year ago. On Saturday (9th) I put most of these clothes into a carrier bag and today (Monday 11th) I took them to a local charity shop. They were pleased to accept them and it looked as though they took other items apart from clothes as donations. There are many items that I haven't discarded because I believe that they will fetch a good price on eBay. But listing on eBay requires time and effort not to mention having to go to the post office. As far as I can see the larger items that would have fetched a sum to cover my efforts of listing them on eBay have already been sold but because I did gain a certain amount of revenue I still believe that I can do the same with the items that remain. Due to this belief they continue to remain. The deep fat fryer is one such item so I will take it to the charity shop when I next get the opportunity.</p>
<p>So today, the 13th I got rid of the deep fat fryer, finally. That was hanging around for at least 2 years doing nothing and making me wonder if I could sell it on the bay. But along with the deep fat fryer I also took the romertopf and more clothes and an amount of books too. It was a very satisfying experience. These were items that were not valuable enough to sell but too valuable to throw in the rubbish.</p>
<p>I have done pretty well this month. As well as finally getting rid of the deep fat fryer I have also got rid of a handful of Buddhist books from when I was involved with what was formerly known as the FWBO or the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order. One of the members of the Order is a wheel client and I asked if he would like to take them for someone who was involved with the movement rather than me giving them to charity. He was very grateful and came to collect them. Two of the books were gifts and were inscribed. I also sold an old laptop that I had been planning to fix. It had sat on the shelf for too long and I feared that it would remain there. Maya has opted for a laptop and I have installed Ubuntu 14 for her on an old Dell Vostro which means my old MDD G4 Mac is now totally redundant. It hasn't gone yet but I have the green light to get rid of it. 13 years of fairly consistent use isn't bad you know.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>On the 10th of May I'm planning to ride a 200km Audax called the Hop Garden. It starts from a village in Kent called Meopham and as it starts at 08:00 and it being a Sunday there are no trains that are early enough to get me to the start on time. I rode out to Ruislip for the London Oxford London ride so I thought I would do the same for this forthcoming ride. Today (Saturday 2nd) I rode to Meopham as a training ride and of course rode back. It's 34km from my house and it took 1h 45mins to get there. That means I'll need to leave just before 06:00 on the Sunday in order to get there in time for some tea and cake before the start of the actual ride. I plotted the route using <a href="http://cyclestreets.net" target="_blank">cyclestreets.net</a> which took me via small backstreets, B-roads and country lanes. It was a very nice route which took me past great swathes of yellow rape fields with warm hazy sunshine falling upon my face. There was a gentle headwind but nothing too difficult. I rode it more or less without a break. I stopped in Meopham to set the route back and then take a photo of the Meopham sign. The ride back started with a long descent which was fairly gentle but lasted more than 10km. I know I will enjoy this at the end of my 200km ride should I decide not to get the train. This was also the first time that I had used my Garmin since the ride to Much Hadham earlier this week when I experienced freezes and slow screen redraws but having cleared the tracklog and turned off the track recording the device performed as smoothly as it ever did in the past. When I got home I felt very fresh as though I had only ridden around the block rather than 70km. I felt very pleased with myself and my level of fitness. I didn't even stop to take any food during the ride but made up for that later on.</p>
<p>Yesterday on the 10th of May I rode the Hop Garden 200 Audax as well as riding to and from the event to make it just over 280km. But I almost didn't ride. I've been bunged up with a cold since Wednesday but in spite of all the symptoms my motivation to ride didn't wane. I had undertaken a good amount of preparation: creating a route to and from the event as well as testing it out, creating a .gpx file from the route sheet and having booked the event so therefore didn't want to lose the opportunity. With RRtY in the back of my mind I wondered that if should miss this ride whether I would get the opportunity to ride another this month. The weather was also predicted to be pleasant. I went to bed early on Saturday evening behaving as though I would ride and set up my bike in readiness.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning at 05:00 I didn't feel particularly good but I noticed that my motivation was still high. I left the house at 05:50 and set off along the route that I had used the previous week to Meopham. I arrived at 07:35 and got my brevet card and the mandatory cup of tea along with as many biscuits I could hold in my hand. I met a wheel building client who was also riding with a friend and said that they would be using the .gpx file that I had created. After chatting to them I took some paracetamol and noticed that the weather was warming up: no need for the soft shell. I set off at the rear of the pack at 08:05 feeling pleasantly comfortable on the bike and noticed that I less I thought about my cold the better I felt. I focused on the pleasant country surroundings, the warmth of the sun and the swathes of bluebells in the woods and rape in the fields. But I wasn't able to keep the cold out of my mind for too long and after a cough or a sniff I was dwelling on it again. On the one hand it was a great route with excellent views and a good amount of sunshine and only a slight wind (although on Romney Marshes I did face some stronger winds) but on the other hand I just felt that I wanted to get it done and go home and lie down. I thought I should take it easy as I was tired but that meant it would take longer to get home. The dilemma was a difficult one. As well as having to deal with boredom and tiredness I also encountered a sense of inadequacy in my speed. Having become more comfortable at this distance after first only just about being able to complete it I suppose I now want to complete it in a faster time especially now that I know that I am capable of riding a distance of 200km in 8h 40mins on good roads. These thoughts niggled at me and the fact that I couldn't go faster than I was going got me a little frustrated which was partly due to having a cold and partly due the fact that I never train for speed. What I've noticed in the past is that when I put in a lot of effort to increase my speed those that seem to be riding at a similar speed tend to catch me very soon which means that a massive increase of effort only gives me an overall gain of say 5 minutes. On shorter event this might be a worthwhile gain but on such a long distance event it's the average overall speed that counts rather than a few peaks so the extra effort which is highly taxing doesn't really help much. It was a good mental exercise to keep focusing on the positive and enjoying the food at the cafés. The first of which was the Kent Gliding Club. I had a cup of tea and spongecake here and generally allowed myself a little longer at stops rather than my usual strategy of taking more numerous breaks but making them shorter. I wanted to treat myself at the café stops to keep myself in good spirits as even if I did manage to complete the ride more quickly that I usually did it would still be a good number of hours. The next stop was the Light Railway Café in Hythe at 83km which was kind of the lunch stop and I arrived here at 12:45. Rather than 'bounce' the control I decided to take my time and eat a good meal so got myself sausage, egg and chips. I didn't rush this nor did I lounge.</p>
<p>As the ride continued and the weather continued to improve I found it harder to enjoy it due to my boredom and frustration even though in terms of fitness I felt on good form. Part of my frustration arose from the experienced older riders passing me and not being able to pass them in return. Audax is more about distance rather than speed and this was the first time that speed was an issue. I'm usually happy to complete the ride inside of allocated the maximum time without any concern of improving my speed and it was one of the reasons I chose Audax as opposed to other forms of organised rides but it has crept into my psyche at some point.</p>
<p>When I finally arrived at the finish I did a lot of coughing and sniffing followed by taking some food. I calculated that if I took the train I would only save a few minutes over riding back. As it turned out it was about half an hour but I had the added satisfaction of having ridden home as well as riding to the start which changed the focus back to distance again.</p>
<p>Having done my randonneur ride early on in the month I haven't been doing much in the way of riding and training. Sunday 24th was the first ride of any distance. I rode it with Luke, a guy who I met the first time I rode the Hop Garden and who has recently been to have his wheels trued. We rode my hilly 100km ride into the Kent Downs and Surrey Hills. It was a warm sunny day which is not what was predicted. Good training for the forthcoming Ditchling Devil ride that we are both booked to ride in about 2 weeks time. I really would have liked to have gone on a longer ride but was happy to be home by 14:00 in order to get on with a few things.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p>This weekend on the 9th of May I decided to have a programming day. As has been the case with previous programming days the focus was to clock at least six hours. Once again I didn't quite manage that so I think I will assign another day this month and rather than try and do six hours again just try and make up the shortfall. On this occasion I managed about 2 and half hours and was very happy with that especially as it was a day prior to a ride and I have a good deal of pressure from work deadlines. But I was able to put all of this to one side and focus. I'm currently focusing on tools as opposed to programming itself such as Vim, Git and TDD or Test Driven Development.I still find it hard to focus with impending deadlines looming but I am determined to get them done by the end of the month so that I can spend more time on pure study.</p>
<p>Even though I have had little time and mental space to do any kind of study I seem to have found a great deal of enthusiasm with things that I was working on before and also with new things. I have installed oh-my-zsh on both my machines. I have been learning vim script and I have been looking into Linux System Administration. Along with this I have been improving my Sass and Git skills. These I have been doing as part of my work. On top of that my jQuery skills have improved a lot too. So even though I have not formally put time aside to work on things it has happened quite organically and gives me more impetus to continue to pursue these subjects when I have more time available without being interrupted. If I do quite the yoga on Tuesdays then it would really inspiring and motivating if I could dedicate it to studying all the topics that I have been enjoying of late.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>The typing practice is continuing albeit sporadically. My speed is holding at the 60wpm mark and my accuracy is around 97%. I'm becoming more and more acutely aware of the mistakes that I make repeatedly. It will be a case of overcoming those mistakes that really takes me forward but in a sense I really don't need to go much faster for things that I do and my 60 wpm is really very adequate.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>Post ride day, feeling a little wiped out I took the deck chair into the garden as it was sunny and read my book. But before I did that I turned off my phone. No, I didn't put it on silent, I turned it off. That felt like such a relief. No alerts or reminders or messages or me checking for them if they aren't there: now I could focus myself entirely on my book, which is what I did. I read for a couple of hours and then took a walk to the high street to drop off some old clothes. When I got back I read a little more but didn't fulfil my six hour quota and got into writing my blog (this) and doing a little internet research. As with the programming day I'll assign another day for reading and make up the shortfall rather than try to do a full day. It seems that the six hours is still proving quite a challenge. I thought that it would only be slightly challenging but 3 hours seems to be the norm so far. It seems to work with cycling so perhaps the strategy should be to get away from home although yesterday I was a bit too tired for that.</p>
<p>Today was meant to be a half reading day as it was a bank holiday (25th) but as I didn't do much work over the weekend I didn't do much reading today, in fact none at all. My goal has been to read for half an hour a day but I haven't been managing that. It's partly down to habit and partly down to distraction. There are other things that are more attractive than reading.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Samaritans</h4></li>
<p>Last month I mentioned that having watched a BBC Panorama programme about suicide I was moved to take action and decided to take a look at a voluntary organisation called the Samaritans. I contacted them and filled out an application form and last night (5th of May) went to an information evening. We were shown a short video and then given a presentation about how it all works followed by questions. It's definitely something that I could do but they do require quite a large time commitment and the training is nine weeks and you are required to complete all of the modules in one sweep. Some of the training days fall on Saturdays which are either ride days or days spent with Maya so I will need to think about whether I am able to commit that amount of time. As well as seeing Maya and going on rides I also have a plan of doing more programming so even though this is a great idea in principle and would certainly be a case of following my heart it would conflict with many of my goals. Perhaps I could do it all and perhaps undertaking this training could help me to manage my time even better than I do now.</p>
<p>On Saturday (23rd) I attended the Samaritans selection day. It was only for a couple of hours or so but was quite intense. I don't want to infringe upon the confidentiality of the process by writing specifically about it here but will describe it as generally as I can. It mainly consisted of discussion groups where we each shared our opinions and views on topics that I would rarely entertain. Topics such as race, sexuality, abuse, mental health, disability and of course suicide. It was interesting to hear everyone's views and also my own. As I give these subjects little or no mental air time or discuss them with friends it was quite an eye opener to air them with a group of strangers. I realised that it had been quite an intense experience when I got back home and getting work done went out the window. At first I tried to resist and pushed myself to crack on with things but I realised that it would  be wise to listen to my needs and be easy on myself. After I did wind down which took a good few hours I did actually do some work.</p>
<li><h4>Fountain Pens</h4></li>
<p>One of my distractions this month and one that has been causing me to stay up late has been my renewed love of fountain pens. I've been watching reviews on YouTube and have bought one that is inexpensive but well regarded. It's the LAMY Safari Vista and it has an extra fine nib as my handwriting is generally very small. I do still enjoy my Pelikan M400 but even with the fine nib I find the line to be too thick and often the word is illegible. I have bought another one called the Pilot Prera which came directly from Japan. I have also bought another extremely inexpensive one which was only &pound;3.00 made in China called the Jinhao X450 also well regarded by the fountain pen community. This is how loves should be: a natural emergence of an urge and this should be allowed to flourish.</p>
</ul>
