<p>As we launch into the month of October I feel that I am looking back over the year already and thinking that I've done rather well this year and that I'm moving from strength to strength. I'm very impressed and happy with what I've achieved and starting to wonder about goals for the forthcoming year even though there are still three whole months left of this one. In the past I remember that around the time of my birthday I sort of review my life and I guess that is starting to happen now.</p>
<p>One other thing that has carried over after writing the report from September 2015 is that because all of these goals are ongoing there isn't a specific end point apart from the Audax goal that I have set for this year which has 3 months left to run. If the other goals had clearer and more defined end points then it would be easier to create monthly sub-goals in order to move towards them more easily. What I've been doing with these reports is simply to account for what has been happening and hopefully to write about it as soon as it happens to keep things as fresh as possible but haven't thought of it as a tool for formulating goals. It does sort of happen by accident but last month after crunching the numbers for a healthier eating plan and coming up with one portion of fruit and veg per meal, I thought I could do a similar thing to my other goals. Sometimes even though a clear end point isn't apparent, if I had to sit down and describe it to someone then a better idea would emerge and it is something that I need to do with each of the goals listed below. It's now the 4th of October so I will set forth as best I can clear ideas of where I am trying to get to with each of these goals.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p>As I've mentioned already in the introduction that I have a goal for this month which is add one portion of fruit or veg to each of my meals. This is for the five days on which I eat my normal amount of calories. It's easy to remember in that you simply have to add one portion every meal. I also eat a lot of bread, especially toast and it makes up a good portion of my diet. When I'm hungry and I don't want to cook, I end up eating a lot of toast. Watching a few healthy eating videos on YouTube I noticed that they mentioned they were trying to cut down or even to eliminate bread from their diet. This wouldn't work for me as I love bread so much but I'm going to try and eat porridge instead of toast along with my new regime of adding scrambled eggs to my breakfast. I'm not planning to do this for each and every breakfast but perhaps for one or two meals just to see how it goes. Obviously I'll report back here. The other idea that I came across with healthy eating was batch cooking. It's something that I've done when my daughter was just coming up to her first year but hadn't thought of doing it longer term. But it struck a chord because one of the main reasons that I end up eating junk food is that when it is time to eat I don't have anything healthy prepared. I often do have the ingredients to prepare a healthy meal but don't want to spend the next 45 minutes to an hour cooking and preparing that meal. I don't enjoy cooking as much as I used to. Batch cooking would make perfect sense on both those counts. I could cook enough for the week and then if I did want to cook or eat something else I would have that option because the meal would be frozen but then if I was in a hurry or just not in the mood I could pop a ready prepared meal into the microwave.</p>
<p>That makes quite a few new ideas to try out this month: extra protein, batch cooking and one portion of fruit or veg per meal on eating days. Oh, and porridge.</p>

<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>I had a little think about my yoga practice and remembered a time when it was an achievement to even get myself on the mat but now that I'm doing that on a regular basis I can start to think about where I want to go with it. With the strength training I can set goals such as x number of pull-ups etc. or being able to do a muscle-up. I think there are certain postures that I would like to master which are a bit beyond my reach either in terms of flexibility or in terms of balance but I would need to work on them. At the moment I'm sort of doing one thing or another without any real plan and also watching something at the same time which is very unfocused. I would like to have a session that is free from distraction and with some clear goals such as working on backbends etc. but still with an element of free-form intuitive work. Now that I have a bit more space in the bedroom i.e. enough room to put down a mat, I can perhaps take myself away from the screen and spend time on the yoga rather than whatever it is I'm watching. I would love to reach the peaks that I reached during the days where I was practicing more intensively but I kind of think of that as a pipe dream rather than a reality. Back then I used to practice 2-3 hours a day but perhaps with the knowledge and experience that I have now I could perhaps achieve that with far less effort.</p>

<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p>One major large item went out the door today and it has been a long time coming. My old Mac G4 along with the keyboard, screen, speakers and the coffee table that it was laid upon. Today being the 6th of October. It was in the bedroom and now that Maya has opted for a laptop it was no longer required and freed up a lot of space. That felt good, that felt really good. But as we are on the theme of where I want to be ultimately with this goal, I suppose it is to reach a point where I don't have anything at home that I'm not sure about. At the moment there are many items that are clear candidates for being discarded, after this there are others that I'm not quite sure about. I would ideally like to have discarded all of the items that need to go and then work my way through all the ones that I'm not sure about. Just make a decision about them. Then it will be simply a case of one in one out or as close to that as can be. I have things that I use or I love and nothing more.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>This month my only goal is to maintain my fitness level and ride a 200km ride. The only thing is that I don't have any weekends free so I can't do any calendar rides. That means I need to ride a DIY. This year I've already two DIY rides both of which have been the Boat Trip. I would rather not ride that one again so have been looking into creating my own DIY route but the whole process seems to be rather confusing. I've been doing a bit of reading on the subject and will just give it a go and learn by doing it. I will ride the Ditchling Devil Perm as a back up in case this one doesn't work out. But the beauty of it is that I would be able to start and finish the ride from a point very close to my house.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>I started to wonder where I would like to be ultimately with my typing and all I could think of was that I would like to make fewer mistakes and also type a little bit faster. Today is the 6th and for the past couple of days I have been using the Type Scout tutor again and it seems that even though I have missed a couple of months I seem to have maintained my speed and accuracy. But the question of exactly where I would like to go still remains unanswered. I suppose a pipe dream might be something like 90 wpm and zero mistakes. I remember reading somewhere that one shouldn't try to increase speed unless accuracy is at 100% but that would be rather discouraging. Let's say for a moment that my pipe dream or what seems to be rather far fetched could actually be possible for me then it would be a jump from a current level of around 48 wpm and 96% accuracy. That's not a massive increase in accuracy but almost double my current speed. How long would that take? How much of an increase could I make per month? Perhaps if I were to continue this month with what I'm doing daily and see how I've done at the end of the month I will get a better idea of how much I am progressing and how long it will take. A bit like weight loss I guess in terms of so many pounds a month.</p>
