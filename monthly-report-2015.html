<p>As I've mentioned above, on the 1st of February I rode the Windrush Winter Warmup 100km ride in the Cotswolds. I had already ridden it before in 2013 but remember that I found it very tough going at the time and also remember that there were hills to climb.  When I had finished I was quite exhausted and my legs were wobbly when coming down the stairs. However, on this occasion I found it so much easier. In the first instance I was using a GPS device which made the navigation far easier. I did ride the same fixed gear bike but didn't find it in any way a struggle and could easily have ridden further. Initially the weather was looking as though there would be ice and snow but that soon cleared and there was soft winter sunshine pretty much all day. It was indeed cold but certainly bearable. The hardest obstacle was the wind and during the second leg of the ride there were headwinds for all of the 32km. The first leg on the other hand was with a tailwind and like most people I rode a non-stop 47km. There was tea and cake at each stop and no info controls which kept it very simple. The start was at 09:00 and I came in at 14:30 ish. I didn't push it but did try and make the most of the downhill sections in the third leg especially to make up for the tough riding during the second stage. I was staying with friends who live only 10 minutes ride away from the start / finish so went back there for a couple of hours before making my way home: Kemble to London Paddington by train then the final cycle of the day from Paddington home. Felt tired but not all exhausted and hungry for more.</p>
