<p>May is about to end in half an hour and I'm looking forward to starting a new month. Lots of things got missed in May so I feel like I want to put it all behind and start fresh.</p>
<p>It's now about half-way through the month and I feel that I've ticked off quite a few things. My 200km audax for the month is done, I've stopped teaching my Tuesday class at the Peak and I have embarked upon the Samaritans initial training. I've also worked out a deal with my landlords about the rent increase and have been thinking about the latter half of the year and how I am going to dedicate more time to programming. I feel relaxed and settled into what I'm doing. Most things seem to be in place and I'm generally enjoying everything that I do. It's really good to feel on top of things and to have a clear sense of how I would cope if things didn't go well.</p>
<p>I had a long FaceTime chat with my cousin and one of the interests that we share is gaming. I haven't done any gaming in a long while and he said that he hadn't either. He recommended some games to me and as they were fairly old i.e. a few years, I was able to purchase them very cheaply second hand. Having discussed our various projects he asked about entertainment and leisure and that he had been missing gaming while he had been studying but now that his course was over it was time to start again.</p>

<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>I almost missed the session on Wednesday 3rd June again due to having been to a meeting during the day but in the end did a partial workout which was better than nothing and I was kind of happy with that. Today, a bit like on Monday 1st I did my workout immediately after my session on the rollers which was great in terms of being warmed up but the session did take some of my strength and energy away which wasn't available for the workout. Still feels like hard work and more like maintenance rather than progress but then seeing how far I have come since I started I have indeed made a lot of progress.</p>
<p>On June 8th, the post ride day after the Ditchling Devil I decided to skip the workout in order to recover from the ride. But then during the other two sessions I made some good progress. Today is another Monday (15th) and I found it hard to motivate myself to do the session. I allowed myself to skip it but did a couple of sets of pull-ups after my roller session.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p>Chocolate, crisps, cheese, toast and take aways. I wouldn't call that healthy. The vegetable count has gone down but I'm still doing the 5:2 fasting and believe that the fasting will clear my system of the toxins and junk that I imbibe from the high fat and sugary diet. But I'm allowed to eat what I like so I indulge.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>I mentioned last month that I was thinking about quitting my regular Tuesday lunchtime yoga class in order to free up the day. After much toing and froing I finally informed the club that I wanted to give up the class and why. They understood but I told them also that I wanted to continue teaching my other class on Thursdays. The class participants were obviously upset but it had to be done. I want to study and work on my programming chops so from next week on the 9th I will no longer be teaching the Tuesday lunchtime class at the Peak. But it doesn't mean that I should skip yoga but definitely do my own practice.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p>Last month was really good in terms of managing to clear a lot of large items but this month the clutter clearance seems to have been neglected. I still have the latter half of the month to keep working at it. One of the things that I learned last month is that I can simply give things away to charity if I don't want to try and sell them on eBay or think that they won't fetch much.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>Strictly speaking it's not riding but I want to get into using my rollers. I bought them as a means to get on the bike when I wasn't able to get out of the house if it was raining or if Maya was here but it just hasn't been happening and in a way I've forgotten about them. I see my lodger using them on a regular basis and I want to do the same but I still need to go through the initial learning curve. At first I thought about scheduling them in once a week but I don't think I'm going to get used to them that way. I need a more intensive break in period so perhaps if I were to use them every day throughout June. Obviously on some days this won't be possible but certainly I can find 15 minutes or so each of the days when I'm going to be home.</p>
<p>I've started a separate set of posts called 30 days of roller training so have a look at those if you want check my progress.</p>
<p>On the 7th of June I rode the Ditchling Devil audax. It was a 200km ride from Wimbledon Common to the Brighton suburbs and then back to Richmond Park. I have written a separate report about my experiences and placed it in a new category called "audax". I think it makes the monthly report a bit too long if I include ride reports here.</p>
<p>With a two week gap between audaxes there is plenty of time to recover and be ready for the next ride but also long enough to lose fitness if you don't train. Therefore on Tuesday 16th I went for a training ride with Brad. It was his route and we started from the Horniman Museum in Forest Hill. We went via Croydon into the lanes near Coulsdon. A beautiful route which covered just over 50 miles and some of the sections of the Ditchling Devil. I rode it fixed as I haven't really ridden any appreciable distance on that bike and in just a few days I will be using it to ride a 300km audax. It was a bit hillier than I had expected but I coped fine, in fact I hardly had to get up and out of the saddle. One section of the route was part of my hilly hundred but we turned off at the foot of one hill. I had anticipated around 100km but in the end we didn't stop and I was home in just over 3 hours. I think that spending time on the rollers has definitely helped.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p>There has been a lot of thinking and planning about this but no real action aside from the shortish programming days and watching a few YouTube tutorials now and then to improve my current skills. It has been frustrating that I haven't been able to clock up the number of hours that I had wanted but now that I am half-way through the year and have also freed up an extra day in the week I think I can redress the balance. I'm not going to try and be over ambitious but seeing that I have clocked around 300 hours of cycling in the first half of the year I think that it's not a tall order to try and clock that many hours of programming in six months. I have clocked about 70 hours already so if I have around 25 weeks of the year remaining then it's something like 10 hours a week to reach my target. Now that I have an extra day available in the week what I'd like to do is to make that day a weekly programming day. As I've mentioned before a realistic number of hours for a "day" be it a reading or programming day is 6 hours. If I can manage this each week on the Tuesday then it leaves only 4 hours to clock up for the rest of the week. If I'm also working on material that genuinely interests me rather than material that I think would be good for me to learn then it shouldn't be too hard to reach that target.</p>
<p>Wednesday 17th was meant to be a programming day but a new website job landed on my plate and I ended up spending some time organising that as well as attending to domestic duties such as shopping, laundry and cutting the grass. I was slightly disappointed but on the other hand I was half expecting something like this to happen as is usually the case. There are also many days till the end of the month so there is ample opportunity to reschedule. Ideally I would like to assign the programming day on a Tuesday as that was one of the main reasons for giving up the class that I teach on Tuesdays.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>This month I've decided to let myself off from typing practice as I'm doing roller training sessions. I still have the reminder on the phone which may trigger me to do it but the pressure is completely off. Hopefully I'll pick it up again in July.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I'm 78% through a book that I was reading last month and ideally I should have finished it and have started a new one this month but it looks as though I'm going to be finishing it during the first week.</p>
<p>I've finished Walden which did get a bit boring towards the end and have plunged into Don Quixote.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
  <p>On Saturday 6th June the Samaritans initial training began. The first session was called Induction and was a 3 hour morning session and essentially went into more depth about the work that they do. Then on Saturday 13th June were the first two modules which were about listening skills. This was a full day from 09:00 to 16:30. In the morning session we looked at how to listen actively to a real voice either in person or on the phone. We also did some role plays to test our knowledge and they were not at all easy. In the afternoon session we looked at email and text messages and how we might reply to them. This was even more difficult than listening to an actual person as you had to think very carefully about how the words conveyed what you were trying to say: there is no tone of voice in the written word so it's more difficult and in practice a second Samaritan is required to check the message before it is sent.</p>
  <p>What astounded me most was the variety of the calls that could be received including silent calls and the number. I got a sense of the extent of the "emotional distress" that is prevalent in the country. The sessions were not as intense as I had expected but they were still emotionally draining and required some downtime to unwind and get back to normal as it were.</p>
