<p>The much anticipated Fallout 4 was released recently and it is for the Xbox One. I have an Xbox 360 which means that I would have to buy an Xbox One and just looking at the prices as of December 2015 I can see that I would have to spend in the region of &pound;300.00. That's quite a lot to pay in order to play a game in spite of how anticipated it may be. I obviously wouldn't only be paying for one game but investing in my gaming future such that I would still be able to play all of my current Xbox 360 games as the Xbox One is backwards compatible. This got me thinking as to whether I should consider my options and perhaps build a gaming computer. If I decide in the end to get myself an Xbox One it would mean that my Xbox 360 would be redundant and I could recoup some of the cost but as it is old it would only fetch &pound;70.00 - &pound;80.00 at most and therefore I would still be spending a good amount on a gaming console.</p>
<p>If I am prepared to spend circa &pound;300.00 on a console then why not spend that money buying parts instead and build a custom gaming PC? PC you say but I have a Hackintosh. Indeed, my current Hackintosh has been very stable and has been running totally without fault for over 18 months. It is my main computer and other than a recent (ish) memory upgrade hasn't seen any changes since the day it was built. But nevertheless I spent a day or so researching and pondering what changes I could make. But then if it ain't broke as they say, why try and fix it.</p>
<p>My first idea was to build a custom PC that would be composed of hardware that was compatible with Mac OSX. I made the mistake though of looking into the details too soon before considering the bigger picture and ended up thinking that I was actually going ahead with this rather than listing as one option. I found YouTube videos that showed how to put together a custom gaming PC which dual booted Windows &amp; Mac OSX and also how to build a gaming PC to support Fallout 4 for a budget of less than &pound;300.00. I finally got my head out of the details and considered another option.</p>
<p>The other option was to find a graphics card upgrade for my current Dell Optiplex machine. Only certain models would fit in there and they also had to consume lower power as the PSU could only provide ~300W in total. It would also need to be Mac OSX compatible. I spent many hours researching but could not find a suitable card that ticked all the boxes. What if I simply quit Mac OSX? On my laptop I use Linux Ubuntu and have done so for many years. Could I live without it? Aside from Adobe applications I don't really use many native Mac programs. I use mainly the browser and the command line. I found an Optiplex compatible graphics card called the R7 250 and most reviews showed it to be a very capable card. Not anywhere near the top of the range but perfectly usable and in fact gave some higher end cards a run for their money. How about an experiment? How about I got this card, which costs around &pound;70.00 and fit it and give my Windows / Ubuntu idea a try? That would be a good way to find out. I did some more reading: people quitting OSX and moving over to Ubuntu.</p>
<p>After a day or two of this frenzied research I remember taking a bath and asking myself to take a look at the bigger picture: what were my actual option? I felt so much that I had to go ahead and make a change that I almost missed the first option, which was to do nothing at all. That's right: there was actually no need for a change. My computer as I mentioned earlier works perfectly and suits all my needs. Why did I need to make any changes at all? This question resulted in two more questions: how much gaming would I actually do if I did have a gaming computer? And did I simply want to build a computer and needed an excuse to do so? The day that followed after all this researching and considering of options I went for a ride to Much Hadham partly to have a ride and partly to fix / rebuild the computer at Artisan Cycles. Getting out of the house cleared my head and the following day I was out teaching. I had soon forgotten about computer building and wondered why the idea had piqued my interest so much.</p>
<p>It reminded me of my teenage years when I used to go to the woods to build treehouses with friends. But we all remarked that it was the building process itself that was the fun part rather than the completion. We got bored when it was done and started planning the next one. I don't need a new computer and to be honest I don't really want to build a new one either. As for gaming I do have an Xbox 360 that works perfectly well: how much gaming do I do at present? Very little. I bought three new titles earlier this year and played them for a short while then stopped. To see how much I really wanted to play I bought a new title, Call of Duty Ghosts, based on a recommendation and I enjoyed it. But it was not a strong connection: I am not the sort of gamer that needs the best possible hardware, enhanced graphics or the plethora of advantages that PC gamers enjoy. I like to pick up a game when the mood takes me and that isn't every day or even once a week. The Xbox 360 that I already own is perfectly adequate for this purpose and it also has a huge back catalogue of games. Add to this that my lodger just brought his own Xbox 360 from his parental home along with at least 30 games, I can enjoy a lot of gaming without paying a penny or making any unnecessary changes. Is Fallout 4 that important? Let's think about this again next year.</p>
