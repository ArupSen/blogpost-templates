<p>It's the 8th of December and I have only just published the monthly report for November so I am feeling a bit behind with things. As I mentioned in that report, one of the things that has delayed many projects is entertainment. As I mentioned in the November report it has been quite guilt free but it still draws time and energy away from other things. Hopefully, I can get the balance right this month.</p>
