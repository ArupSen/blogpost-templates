<p>On the way home I was finding it very easy to pedal. It seemed effortless and I was looking forward to a spell on the rollers when I arrived. I plugged <a href="http://bassdrive.com" target="_blank" title="bassdrive baby">bassdrive</a> into my ears and set the countdown timer on my phone. Once I had started the screen soon switched off but no matter. I was loving it. So far I have been having bursts of speed at 10 and 5 mins remaining. But with nothing to inform me of that I decided to try "Fartlek" or speed play. It's a type of interval training where you hit a fast interval at random rather than at a designated time. I was already riding fast so didn't need much encouragement. I think I did four bursts in all which is twice as many as my usual two. Towards the end I decided to just maintain a steady rhythm pedalling to the sounds in my ears. I am also getting confident with the balance and even swayed on purpose to show myself that I could. I continued for a minute or two after the countdown had stopped. Really enjoyed it and looking forward to the next session.</p>
