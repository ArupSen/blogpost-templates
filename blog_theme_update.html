<p>Since I started my blog back in 2007 I created my own theme based upon the then default theme and even though I have created many Wordpress themes for clients I have never created one for my own blog. At one point I made some drawings to try and examine the content that I wanted to display and possible layouts. But those ideas never got past the drawing stages, not even to a mock up development site. The main work that I've been doing on clients sites over the past year or so is to make their websites mobile compatible which meant that if I did get around to building a new theme for my blog I would have to do the same thing. I really don't have an interest in layout design, at least not as much as I used to, so what I decided to do was to find a free theme that was close enough to what I wanted and then changing a few things here and there. It reminded me of my early days building Wordpress sites where I spent the bulk of my time browsing themes. Themes don't exclusively focus on layout design (colours, typography and spacing) but also which content is displayed. For example, should the sidebar be displayed in single page view.</p>
<p>I settled on a theme called <em>typefocus</em> as my blog is heavily text based and some of the posts are quite long with very few pictures. I wanted something that leant towards good readability and typography. There may be others that would also work well but I found this one after only half an hour of searching via the Wordpress admin panel.</p>
<p>In the process I upgraded the main Wordpress core files which they have now made so easy with only one click. In the past this had to be done manually and took around 20 minutes and you wondered if all of your plugins would still work. You still need to check that but I have only a minimal amount of them and anything that could be done without bloating the system with a plugin especially if it's trivial I code myself. There are still a few adjustments that I need to do but I think it's 90% there and I will probably continue to use this theme for a good while.</p>
