<p>Having set it as a possible goal for 2016 that I ride a double parallel RRtY I wanted to get a 2nd ride done for January. I still hadn't committed myself to undertake this challenge but thought it best to get the January ride completed if I should next month have a change of heart. During the weekend of the 24/25 of January I decided to pick a ride that would require the minimum of preparation and then pick a day to ride it. There were no pressing engagements impending and the weather forecast for Monday looked agreeable and so on the evening of the 25th I emailed the DIY organiser for the SE region, Paul Stewart, informing him that I would like to ride a DIY 200km Permanent the following day and that the details other than some minor modifications of the route were identical to the one that I had ridden in October 2015. I received a prompt reply that my entry had been accepted nad now all that remained was going to bed early.</p>
<p>I had no problem at all going to bed early as the swimming earlier that day had left me rather drowsy and very hungry. I set my alarm for 04:30 which is customary for me for any 200km ride although was not necessary in this case due to the ride starting very close to my home. I awoke at 03:50 feeling amply refreshed and wrote my morning pages which is something I tend to miss on my ride days. The customary three rounds of toast; a peanut butter and jam sandwich for the road and diluted squash in my second bidon for the latter stages of my ride.</p>
<p>I set my GPS to record track and left the house at 05:25 and was at the starting point, Sydenham Station in less than 5 minutes. I remember from the last time that I had ridden this route that my Garmin Etrex 20 GPS unit had powered off even on the way to the start. This was of course very worrying and it happened many times during that ride. It happened again during the South of Bucks Winter Warmer in December but not on the Willy Warmer where I rode my fixed gear bike. It was my new stem that was obviously causing excess vibration and shaking the batteries loose. The previous night when loading  my newly edited track on to the unit along with freshly charged AA batteries I also cut a small rectangle from a J-cloth and placed it inside the battery cover in the hope that it would dampen the vibration and hold the batteries more firmly in position. I witnessed no powering down of the unit during the ride and concluded that my J-cloth solution had been a success.</p>
<p>Without any particular ceremony I set off from Sydenham Station at 05:35. I thought it best to make an early start as I was already up and that way beat the commuter traffic and of course get home much earlier. It was cold, dark and the roads seemed quite deserted. But there was a distinct lack of wind and the air smelled clean and fresh. It seemed that my earlier doubts and inner protestations were not manifesting themselves and I was indeed enjoying myself.</p>
<p>After some back roads and minor roads I found myself at Sevenoaks where I was expecting heavy traffic but encountered quite the opposite case. This allowed me to pass through this section quite quickly and quietly before rolling my tyres onto country lanes proper. It was still dark but I could see the sky brightening very gradually and I made my way to Tonbridge, my first control. The roads were wet and even though there was only a thin layer of surface water it was enough to cause a continuous spray of very dilute mud. I have no mudguards on my geared bike and therefore was completely exposed to this wetness shooting up at me sometimes more dilute and at other times more like runny sludge. It wasn't long before my feet were wet and having assumed that the lanes would be dry I had chosen to ride without overshoes. Being wet my feet grew cold quickly and remained that way for most of the day. The rest of my body remained warm and quite comfortable which in some ways made up for the lack of feeling in my toes.</p>
<p>I came out of the lanes on the main road leading into Tonbridge a little earlier than expected and proceeded to pass through it. I missed a turn just before the control and walked my way back to it. The control I had designated was a garage a couple of hundred metres left of the route. I wasn't in need of any refresnhements or even a break so merely passed through it in order that the track log would record my passage. I set the garage as a control because often on Audaxes garages are set as controls and if someone (myself or another rider) did want to stop there and purchase some refreshments then they would be able to find it here due to the route passing the outer edge of the town rather than through the centre.</p>
<p>I had been cycling about 2 hours and it is usually after this amount of time that I would normally stop to take a break but I was feeling good and felt as though I wanted to continue to ride that is what I did. I was concerned that if I did not pace myself I would feel tired or a distinct lack of energy later on in the ride, but I decided to risk it and see how long I would continue to ride before coming to a natural break. I didn't actually take a long break until I reached Charing which is about 84km into the ride and aside from a very short toilet break I had been riding consistently for four and a half hours. This was quite a record for me as my ride periods never extend beyond two and a half hours. I felt no ill effects and there was no back or wrist pain as is usually the case and what prompts a break.</p>
