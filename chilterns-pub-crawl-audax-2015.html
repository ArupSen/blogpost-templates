<p>It was the 1st of November 2015, the day of the Chilterns Pub Crawl Audax. I was prepared and had even cleaned my cassette: the first time that I had ever done that since getting the bike. It was dirty; it was really dirty. I noticed that the gear hanger was loose but other than that it was all good. I also prepared the GPS file adding in all the controls. I didn't buy any snacks because I know I tend to just bring them back home.</p>
<p>I have this habit of waking up long before the alarm and today was no different. This time it was 03:00. I was due to wake up at 04:30 so I settled myself down again when I had cooled down. Mild for a Halloween night.</p>
<p>At 04:30 I had my three rounds of toast and packed the remaining bagel from my birthday breakfast. It all felt so routine having done this so many times this year. It was foggy and damp which added an eerie glow to a deserted street at 05:30. I was riding to the start in Ruislip. I knew the way to Notting Hill and my GPS aided route started from there. After a few backstreets of North Kensington I was riding along the side of the A40. Even at that time of day on a Sunday morning it was busy. There was a cycle lane next to the main road so I rode it. I had time to spare so I rode slowly especially as it was foggy and there were leaves on the road. As far as possible I wanted to hold back my strength for the hills.</p>
<p>The Waters Edge Pub next to Ruislip Lido was the start / finish point, the same as one I had ridden earlier this year: London-Oxford-London (although the start was on the other side of the Lido). A small group had gathered and I could see the sun through the mist. I had taken a new ballpoint pen for the information controls but infuriatingly it didn't work.</p>
<p>A quiet unceremonious departure not unlike many Audax starts and we were on our way. I had taken a couple of muesli bars that the organiser was handing out and had eaten one whilst we were waiting to depart, along with a banana. There were many faces that I recognised especially now that I was becoming somewhat of an hold hand with nearly three years of Audax riding under my belt.</p>
<p>I made no attempt to keep pace with the leading group and went through all the strategies that had helped me during the last hilly ride. Hold myself back for the hills; get a balance between speed and minimum effort; use core strength during climbs and descents; use lower gears which I tend to avoid on flatter courses. I didn't heed my own advice till a bit later into the ride but at least I did.</p>
<p>It wasn't long before the sun came out and the fog drifted away. There were blue skies and a warm that was rare for a November day. Time to remove that jacket. But perhaps I should combine stopping to remove my jacket with a short break as there were no manned controls till the Café in the Woods at the halfway point and the first shop stop was at 70km.</p>
<p>The route loosely followed the same roads as the Boat Trip perm which was familiar to me as I have ridden it twice this year. I wondered if he had borrowed from it but when I asked him about it at the finish he seemed to take offence and became defensive. He had suffered a good amount of criticism during the development of the route so his reaction was understandable. At 25km disaster struck with a puncture. It was while descending a gravelly lane after Great Kingshill. I had to stop obviously and walk until I could find a spot where I could change the tube. I had considered taking two tubes but in the end I had decided against it. Now I regretted that decision. Many riders passed as I was putting on my blue Nitrile gloves ready to work on my wheel. They were all very polite and helpful. I don't know why their offers of help irritated me: it was only a puncture but how would they know that? I also hadn't expected so many to be behind me as I presumed that I was near the back of the field.</p>
<p>I took my time with the repair because having only one spare tube I couldn't afford a 2nd puncture. Getting a pinch flat or allowing a bit of gravel to enter would be fatal, especially now that I truly was at the back of the field: how could I ask for help? I took a snack and set off again slowly till I was at the end of the gravelly path. The sun was still shining and the sky was still clear. I soon arrived at the first control, an information control and met a couple of riders taking a break. I borrowed a frame pump from one of them and put a little more air in the tyre.</p>
<p>Very soon I had forgotten all about the setback and was absorbed in the ride once more, taking in the gorgeous scenery, the clear air and the vistas of autumnal hues. After a 2nd information control where I stopped for only a minute there was a receipt control at Watlington. There was a small square (very small) with a long covered bench opposite a Co-op supermarket. Sunshine bathed the bench and riders were taking a break and soaking up the rays. I bought some food and joined them. It seemed that in spite of my delay due to the puncture I wasn't too far back. But then Audax is about distance and not speed. This was around the 70km mark and I had arrived a little after midday so I was travelling at my usual pace of 20km/h.</p>
<p>After a good feed of sausage roll, crisps and a couple of Mars cake bars (they were on offer) I refilled my water bottle and hit the road once more. Most of the riders who were there when I arrived had already left and others that came later had 'bounced'.(Bouncing in Audax terminology refers to stopping very briefly at a control or even not at all.) After my puncture stop there had been a bit of an urge to catch up but after my meal that feeling faded and I could once again relax into the ride. </p>
<p>The worries that I used to experience such as being able to complete the distance or being able to complete it in the given time were very much a thing of the past. This was a 200km ride and I was already adding 72km to it with my transit from my house to the start. Having also ridden many rides in excess of 300km this year I am more than confident about completing the distance in the allotted time. But the idea of speed still haunts me. I tell myself that I don't care about speed and I have a lodger who is a sprinter who cares very much about speed but obviously I do care because I think about it and that I would like to be faster. But it's not something to work on during the ride but I do often wonder how some of the riders are so much faster than me. Some will be race riders who are affiliated with cycling clubs where they race or generally ride at a much faster pace. Some are time trialists. But how much faster would I like to go? I need to answer these questions because I am very much in denial about speed: I keep telling myself and others that I care not a jot about speed, but I do. I need to acknowledge that I want to go faster.</p>
<p>A friend and fellow Audax rider was visiting family who live in the area through which I would be passing. In fact the halfway lunch control was only 12km away and he said he would come and say hello. After the stop in Watlington we exchanged messages to work out our ETA. But then came the tough hills. Long and winding, steep and brutal. Going the opposite way these would be scary descents. The toughest one I found was Bledlow Ridge which required the use of my lowest gear and a level of concentration that helped to direct all of my efforts to the act of keeping those pedals turning. My heart was beating hard, my lower back was in pain, I could feel little twinges in my knees and I was struggling to maintain a rhythm with my breathing. Doubts were rushing and there was a strong urge to stop and get off. I looked down instead of looking up or forward. I didn't want to see how far I had left to climb: I wanted to stay focused on the act of climbing itself. I wanted to maintain my rhythm. That was what would get me up that hill rather than knowing if I had 2 minutes or 3 minutes of this intense workout remaining. Soon after reaching the summit my efforts were rewarded with some spectacular views of the Chilterns landscape and at this time of the year painted in tints of yellow, ochre, burgundy and brown. The light was softened by the hint of mist that still lingered. As beads of sweat trickled from my brow and my breathing grew calmer I relaxed and took it all in.</p>
<p>Another information control and another pub: it was a Pub Crawl after all. I saw one rider drinking a pint while he took a break. He said that he had also had a pint of lemonade with it. He was clearly hydrated. I would meet him again later on. It was the Whip Inn at Lacey Green and after another Mars cake bar I messaged my friend to say that I would be arriving at the Café in Wendover Woods in an hour or so. Only 16km but I suspected some steep gradients along the way.</p>
<p>After some more descents and even some flat sections and a permanent smile from beholding the beauty that was presented to me, the climbing began again. The café at Wendover Woods was the highest point in the Chilterns and to reach it would mean further stress placed upon my already depleted body. But I knew I would be taking a break there and I knew I would be meeting Luke. It was challenging, gruelling, arduous and exhilarating at the same time. It took all of my efforts just to keep those pedals turning. It was a narrow road and visitors in cars were also making their way up those roads. I tried not to be annoyed at them. I tried to imagine that they were being driven by a friend who would cheer me on. I am usually annoyed by drivers in general but when a friend in a car passes then they cease to be an anonymous driver or motor vehicle wanting the road to themselves but simply a friend who just happens to be in a car. Even though support vehicles contravene the rules of Audax I imagined that one of these passing cars was a friend come to meet me. If they honked their horn it wasn't in annoyance but a greeting. I immediately felt a more positive connection with the traffic and the sounds of the cars spurred me on rather than sapped my strength.</p>
<p>I saw a sign saying that this was the highest point in the Chilterns and a wooden building with rows of picnic tables next to it which was obviously the café. I saw bicycles parked against this building and also against trees. I parked my own against a tree and noticed once I had dismounted how great an effort it had required to reach the café in Wendover Woods. I scanned the area to see if I could spot the actual control and sure enough I noticed an elderly couple seated at a table next to the café verandah. I greeted them with a puff and a pant much like the riders that came after me. They said that someone had been asking for me and I immediately noticed Luke sitting at the table on the verandah. I joined him as soon as my brevet card had been signed and he offered me a fresh cup of coffee. I accepted gladly and we got on with catching up. There was long queue at the café reaching well outside the door. It was 3.00 pm and it was a sunny day and a good crowd had gathered. I kept an eye on it and went to join it once it had shortened. A sandwich, a thick slice of carrot cake and a pastry for later, along with coffee to replace the one that Luke had kindly offered me. I wanted to sit down and recover from the great effort and also chat to Luke: both good reasons not to bounce the control. When I'm riding alone I find it harder to stop and rest so meeting Luke at this point was very timely. I really appreciated his coming to meet me there and for him it was a great way to keep in touch with the Audax world when it wasn't possible to ride.</p>
<p>After what seemed like a very long break which was only just under 40 minutes I set off again. I was hoping that many of the climbs had been traversed and that the 2nd half of the ride would have fewer climbs. Luckily, I was right.</p>
<p>It wasn't long before the sun began to set and with the clear skies the full glory of the fading light could be enjoyed. But once the sun had set fully the fog returned. This time it seemed thicker than it had been in the morning and also wetter. I could feel it condensing on my head and drops trickling down my forehead. The light from my headlamp seemed to be reflected back against the tiny droplets in the air rather than from the road ahead. I could therefore only see a short distance ahead and for the sake of caution I reduced my speed and turned all my efforts to keeping a watch for potholes.</p>
<p>There was one more manned control before the final one at the Chilterns Gateway Centre. Now that it was dark it could be seen clearly on the hillside like a big luminous glass cube. A solitary volunteer whom I recognised from previous Audax rides was manning the control seated outdoors on a bench. He said that he had been there since midday. I had now caught up with the rider drinking the pint next to the Whip Inn and we decided to ride together. He described himself as a plodder and as our paces were closely matched I guess that made me a plodder too. We rode quietly for a time in single file but once the route had flattened we rode side by side and introduced ourselves properly. Only minutes later his GPS unit was giving him a low battery warning. We decided to pick up the pace as he wanted to see how far he could get before the battery was totally drained. I could sense that the anxiety was spurring him on so I rode behind. I saw a waypoint marker being displayed on my own GPS screen and he didn't see me stop to count chimneys. Nearly all of the information controls were pubs (hence the name of the ride) and the question to be answered were how many chimneys they had. It was of course hard to see this in the dark and the fog made it even harder. After squinting into the darkness and no-one in the pub car park asking what I was doing I continued on my way.</p>
<p>It wasn't long before I had caught up with that rider again but not without a short pit stop myself. My own GPS unit had given me the low battery warning and I knew that from then on I would have one more hour. I had a spare set of batteries but wondered if I should change them right then or wait till they were totally flat. What if I missed a turn? That was reason enough to stop and change them. At the next road junction there was a wooden bench where I stopped. I took a snack, changed my GPS batteries and did a few stretches, not to mention a long awaited toilet break. I had the cover of darkness so I felt safe.</p>
<p>Mark, the guy I was riding with in the last section was standing at the side of the road reading his route sheet and looking at his map. I told him that I had just put in fresh batteries and would be happy to 'tow' him. He gladly accepted. The fog got thicker and I kept squinting into the darkness, trying to see beyond the glare. We stopped at the final information control at 170km. The pub looked closed and it was near impossible to make out the chimneys. Time for that final push to the finish.</p>
<p>I suggested that it would take around 90 minutes to ride to the finish provided that there were no more hills. There were indeed more hills but none with the severity of those that we had encountered leading up to the halfway point. But being fatigued the difficulty level was moved up a notch. The final section was again following some of the roads that were familiar to me from the Boat Trip and on that ride it concludes with a couple of very steep climbs. But thankfully the route changed when it came to that point. Then sections of Rickmansworth and Denham that I didn't know. I was glad that my GPS unit hadn't switched itself off as had happened during my previous ride. An extra layer of masking tape inside the handlebar mount had dampened the vibrations and the unit had performed as flawlessly as it always had.</p>
<p>After the very last turn we shook hands before walking our bikes to the entrance of the Waters Edge pub in Ruislip. Mark thanked me by buying me a pint. I chose a real ale and it was the first time that I had consumed any alcohol at the end of a ride. Even though it was another 2 hours ride home I took my time and chatted to the organiser, Tim Sollesse. He seemed to be bit put out when I mentioned the similarities with the Boat Trip ride. I told him that I had been asked to organise a ride and asked how it had been for him organising this one. He said that even though the end result was rewarding, the entire experience hadn't been wholly a pleasant one with a good deal of unexpected criticism.</p>
<p>It was about 10pm when I set off for my ride home. Tired, pitch black and still foggy I mounted my bike and followed the reverse route from Ruislip to Notting Hill. But before I knew it I had missed a turn and ended up on busy dual carriageway. I had a rough idea of where I was and saw signs for Southall: I knew the way from there.</p>
<p>It was almost midnight by the time I arrived home. On the way I was thinking about getting a take away but I didn't want to go out again once I was home and besides, my bagel had returned. I made it into a tuna bagel and watched an episode of the Flash before drifting into the land of nod.</p>
