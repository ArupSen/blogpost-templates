<p>I want to ride a report of my ride on the 15th of July 2016 but I don't want to go through it step by step or stroke by stroke and aim to cover all that happened on the ride. I get anxious not to miss any details. For this report I want to recount random non-chronological snapshots of events during the ride. Feelings and impressions that were present but also memories of them that weren't exactly how things really happened just how I remember them. A true testimony of events and an embellished account.</p>
<p>At around 09:30 on Saturday morning when the sun was fully warm and starting to dry out the dew it made for a comfortable bed. There was no gate to the field but hedgerows sheltered it from the road. I lay down a good ten metres from the opening and used my pannier as a pillow. I had gone into the field to remove my tights and arm warmers as the temperature began to rise. But having put them away the head made me drowsy and I took my first proper sleep of the ride.</p>
<p>Beer. Real Ale. It was called Doom Bar. When I arrived for the curry meeting many were drinking pints and it was something that I really didn't want to do having had only a very short nap and also not being used to drinking much. But I was thirsty and there were some drinking non-alcoholic beverages. I could follow suit. But I waited for the meal. By then I was very thirsty and without counting it appeared that those drinking pints of beer far outnumbered those that were not. I ordered one and it was as good as I had expected and I hankered after a second pint and even now two weeks later I yearn for the taste. But although it made for a pleasant meal it was probably the main cause of my drowsiness during the night: I have never fought so hard to stay awake.</p>
<p>Water. Met a guy getting supplies at the control just after Cambridge: an all-night garage. Instead of a regular bidon water bottle he had a 2 litre plastic bottle in his cage. He replaced the cap with a specially made one that had a long plastic tube through it with the other end near the handlebars. He said that would keep him going till the next control. I would be happy if I managed to get through half a litre.</p>
<p>Bus shelter. Across the road from where the wind turbines were whooping around. This was the perfect bus shelter for sleeping: solid walls and a wooden bench all the way across. Warm and dark. But I wasn't sleepy. When you find a suitable shelter you aren't sleepy and when you are there are none to be found.</p>
<p>Puncture. On the way to the the pre-ride curry at Jalsa Ghar in Great Dunmow I got a puncture. I was running a little early so I had plenty of time to repair it. I thought of asking someone there if they might have had a track pump but it got forgotten. Perhaps another reason why I found it hard going. When I finally got home the pressure was 60 psi. What a drag. The pannier was heavy too.</p>
<p>Headwinds. During the second section from Peterborough to Newport Pagnell it was night time and across the Fens with no hedgerows: all one big open flat landscape; no escape from the wind. It felt like a constant uphill battle. Add to that feeling drowsy to the point of falling asleep and toothache and you can feel that continuing to pedal was all that I could do. It was not until the first light of the sun that I found a windbreak in the form of a thick and tight hedgerow. I sat behind it and suddenly the wind was gone. I watched the sky grow brighter and took a break. One of many.</p>
<p>Toothache. A strong tingle, a numbness, a minor tremor emanating from the right side of my lower jaw. It encompassed by right eyeball, my right ear, my right nostril and the glands under the jaw between it and the side of the neck. It had been a good seven years since my last visit to the dentist and many a tooth had broken and crumbled in the intervening period but with little or no pain. There was a little crater where a filling had come out and the hole had grown larger and was collecting food. The tiniest of lightning bolts in the eye of the storm that was taking place in my mouth resounded with every heartbeat and boomed like a shockwave at the end of each beat. I had Ibuprofen tablets with me but wanted to keep them as a last resort. I was tired and drowsy and the toothache was helping me to stay awake.</p>
<p>Broken cleat. The chap with the two litre bottle of water and specially fitted cap had lost a bolt from one of the cleats of his shoes. When I arrived at the M1 services near Newport Pagnell I saw two bikes locked to one of the round wooden picnic benches outside the entrance of the shopping arcade. I locked mine to the third bench. I couldn't see anywhere to park bikes after all you wouldn't expect bikes at a motorway service station. Small groups of car travellers entered and exited the arcade. It was breakfast time. When I had got my now familiar snack and bottle of water I saw the two owners of the bikes seated at a table next to the one where the bikes had been secured. They turned to look at me as I adjusted my luggage and I asked if I could join them to which they heartily agreed. They had hot food and drink and were surprised to see me eating only scotch egg. In my defence I showed them that I also had a packet of Waitrose chocolate chip cookies. I told them that I preferred to have more frequent snacks than to take larger meals. The conversation then turned to the cleat and how having lost one of the screws of the cleat the shoe could not be removed from the pedal. An Audax moment if ever I saw one. Myself and the other rider investigated the shoe and pedal in vain and could offer no suggestions other than to find a bike shop at the next town and seek their assistance. Not wishing to delay myself further when they went indoors to return their trays I departed.</p>
