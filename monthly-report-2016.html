<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>For this month I will continue with the same routine as last month mainly due to missing sessions. Even though I am almost at a stage where I could move on to the next exercise I don't want to do that till I'm totally comfortable with the current exercises and can perform them with good form. If I am feeling brave then I would like to take the rings to the park at some point and do a slightly different routine but no pressure of course.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Diet</h4>
<p>Having missed a few protein rich meals last month I began to wonder if my protein focus was the best idea but as I haven't come up with a better one I will stick with it. What I do aim to do this month is to go to Lewisham market and stock up on some vegetables: when I have a glut of produce I tend to use it and thus incorporate more veggies into my meals.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Yoga practice</h4>
<p>I've been meaning to create a routine that I can work on now and again but out of fear that it becomes the norm I have avoided it so far. Also out of laziness I guess. This is something that I'd like to do this month.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing Clutter</h4>
<p>My plan this month is to chuck one, put one on eBay and give one away. I've already put two items on eBay and hopefully they will sell. As I've often said in previous posts that I can often think that it's not really worth doing unless it's a big item.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>Aside from a (what I'm now calling) short 100km Audax on the 8th with friends the other rides I have planned are perms. One in the middle of the month and one at the end. I'm still half behind my plan to complete a double parallel RRtY and I want to keep up my fitness for my first 400km ride at the beginning of June. The ride at the end of the month will be a multi-day ride which should give me an idea of what it might be like to ride a 600km distance which I plan to attempt at some stage this year.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming</h4>
<p>Having achieved very little last month and feeling very little enthusiasm to engage in the subject I have set the bar much lower. My goal for this month is to work on a hard challenge on Code Eval which will bring together many of the aspects of programming that I have learned and to write a good amount of code rather than merely tinkering with little examples. To help motivate me I have bought a whiteboard and having a larger space to visualise the problem and to have there displayed on the wall may be just the thing. I'll also continue with the jQuery tutorial series that I started last month.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>For the last 2 months I have been working more on accuracy than speed. To start with this seemed to slow me down but the speed has started to gradually creep up again and therefore I will maintain this strategy for May.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I'm a month behind with my one book per month goal but then my main goal is to work through the complete works of Charles Dickens so even though I am a little slower than expected I am still continuing with it. I thought perhaps I might do a very short session of speed reading using the app that I have had for a few years on the iPad as a kind of pre-reading warm up.</p>
<li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
<p>As well as my required number of shifts as a listening volunteer I have been thinking about what other role I could perform at the branch. I was asked to be involved with Caller Support but it doesn't really interest me that much. I have been considering the idea of running a monthly yoga class and giving the profits to the branch. As I have been cutting back on the amount of yoga that I teach this may backfire so I'm keeping it as pending for now. But in general I do want to promote Samaritans as an organisation and to that end I am planning to be more public about the fact that I am involved. I am going to get a Samaritans cycling jersey which I can wear while riding to create awareness and I can also say something about my involvement on the About page of my wheel building site which needs an update as it hasn't had one since 2009.</p>
<li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
<p>At the start of the year my one-off goals were to find a part-time job and to work on that web service and after 4 months of the year having passed and having spent little or no time to move towards it I am wondering if I really want those things at all. I mean surely they would give me more more income but as I seem to be breaking even I don't seem to care about that side of my life. But what about saving for a rainy day? I don't seem to care about that either. I have been thinking about Librivox (reading chapters of audio books as a volunteer) but again don't want to put pressure on myself because essentially I want my life to be a leisurely one. So I really don't have any one-off goals as such this month.</p>
