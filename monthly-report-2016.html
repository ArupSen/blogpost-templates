<p>It's the 13th of the month as I write this and for various reasons (mainly neglect) I have not set my goals at the start of the month and that means that I feel very behind with it all not knowing exactly what it is that I'm working on. I know that most of my goals are ongoing so I'm sort of safe but it would be nice to have that clearer idea and to be able home in on that. So aside from Audax and Reading which I did set at the start of the month the rest will be set now.</p>
<p>Not much in the way of ongoing reporting this month so I'm going to summarise as much as I can now at the end of the month. I've managed to follow most of my goals but have been doing a good amount of gaming and watching TV series and even though I have enjoyed that very much it has left me feeling a bit lazy in terms of getting anything done. It's been a laid back month with a leisurely feel especially as wheel orders were down compared to last month and nothing in the way of website work. Yoga clients were also away which left me with whole days to sit on the sofa and enjoy Xbox gaming and watching 2 Broke Girls. Good times.</p>

<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>My goal is to focus more on the rings and to find a routine that is a little bit different to what I have been doing more or less for the whole of the year. I don't want a big change but little variations here and there and doing most if not all of the exercises on the rings will do that.</p>
<p>I managed to take the rings to the park for the very first time during the week starting the 6th of May and also did it 3 times that week as the weather was suitable. Doing it in public makes it a touch more difficult but being outdoors is very exhilarating and I enjoyed it very much. The self-consciousness died away over those 3 days and I think that I will do my workout in the park whenever the weather is nice. I also watched a good amount of YouTube videos to help motivate me and read about the benefits of rings and the best movements and exercises for beginners.</p>
<p>Following that week I was only able to visit the park for training one other time due to the rainy weather but did continue at home. Motivation has gone down a bit and I haven't been keeping track of reps as I have done in the past in order to assess my progress and that sort of leaves me without a sense of where I am in terms of moving on to the next exercise. I allow myself time to recover from rides etc. but I also want to start making progress with my strength training. This month has been mainly about maintenance so at least I haven't quit.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Diet</h4>
<p>The goal is to get my 2 days a week fasting on track again as well as my meal plans such as tuna salad for lunch. My housemate tends to eat egg salads more than anything and I think it would be a great standby if I didn't happen to think of anything when it wasn't a junk food night.</p>
<p>I can't think of a better system than to base all of my meals around protein so I've continuing with that and so far this month slowly but surely I'm getting there.</p>
<p>At the end of the month I am a little disappointed that I wasn't able to maintain a decent diet. An excess of junk food which I have to say I enjoyed very much but a definite lack of protein and vegetables.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Yoga practice</h4>
<p>My goal is to continue with what I set at the start of the year which was to work on the free standing handstand and this month also to simply stay in postures a little longer.</p>
<p>Using my bodyweight or some other weight to gradually sink into postures has been very satisfying as well as resuming my handstand focus.</p>
<p>The 2nd half of the month even though I kept up my practice I still seem to be doing it in a distracted way, either looking at my phone and engaging in chat or watching something. I'm happy that I'm doing something and keeping up the routine but disappointed that I don't have any sort of sequence that I work on regularly.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing Clutter</h4>
<p>Really can't think of a goal but as there is a bric-a-brac collection for Samaritans I can put a few things into that. The items I listed on eBay didn't sell so I will need to have a rethink about those items. I have items that are too valuable to throw out but not valuable enough to try to sell.</p>
<p>I did manage to give out a couple of songwriting books on long term loan and hopefully they won't be returning them too soon.</p>
<p>I managed to give a couple of things to the car boot sale for Samaritans but that was about all. I still have some bike bits that I'd like to discard somehow.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>This month I have only 2 rides planned: a 400km ride on the 4th (my first) and a 300km ride on the 19th (one that I rode last year that I enjoyed so much I would like to ride again). Having achieved so much in May I'm going to step back a little. Both of these rides I plan to ride fixed gear.</p>
<p>Both my 400km and 300km ride went well. In spite of the rainy weather in June it just happened to be sunny on the 4th and 19th. I haven't decided yet whether I will write a fuller report of the rides especially now that much time has elapsed and much detail has been lost but I enjoyed them very much and the fact that I was very comfortable and in a good mood all day.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming</h4>
<p>I suppose the goal this month would be to continue to work on the TDD and use that as a means of solving Code Eval challenges as this is still inspiring me. I still wonder about my Code School subscription and think that I ought to be using it but then sometimes we do order things or book things and when the time comes don't feel much in the mood for it. Sunk costs etc.</p>
<p>I have written the problem on the whiteboard and have set up a Jasmine environment but that's all so far, not one test.</p>
<p>Writing the problem on the whiteboard was about as far as I got with programming this month. I cancelled my Code School subscription but asked them to give me a credit so that I should go back to it at some point. This does leave me wondering where I'm at with this goal and whether it should even be removed from the list. It is something that I want to pursue and something that I do enjoy but at the moment I seem to have lost the urge and also be well engaged with other things. Let's leave it on there for now and see if it comes back.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>The goal is to continue as before: working on accuracy over speed and looking to maintain what I have and gradually increase my speed without any great urgency.</p>
<p>Only missed one session and still really enjoying it. Speed does seem to be inching up.</p>
<p>In the middle of the month I missed a week but other than that my twice a week regime continues. Speed is going up gradually as well as accuracy. As I'm mentioned above, no rush.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I'm going to be a little ambitious and set a goal of a Reading Day this month. I've set this goal so many times and have failed to achieve it but I'm going to set it anyway: perhaps this month I will actually have that day. The other goal is to complete The Old Curiosity Shop and start the next book in the series.</p>
<p>Haven't set a Reading Day as yet but have been dipping into the book without having to tell myself that I need to work on it.</p>
<p>As expected, the Reading Day didn't happen. The day after a ride I'm always too tired to concentrate on a book. A lot of the time I would find that I would start to read but then put the book down and gravitate towards watching something or reading short articles online. Also if I had spare time when I had the opportunity to read I would either not really think of it as an option or I would consider other ways to occupy my time.</p>
<li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
<p>Many things to work on now that I'm a committee member. The first really would be to define my new role as publicity lead. Then to complete the Trustee training because committee members are also trustees. I also want to become a mentor which means reading through the mentor handbook and there is my idea of teaching yoga to fundraise so I need to figure out if that is possible.</p>
<p>I helped out with an information evening and it was interesting to be on the other side and  be seen as the Samaritan. It gave me chance to talk to someone who might be able put me in touch with a venue where I could teach yoga. The following week I also got a chance to speak to someone who deals with the mentoring process and who gave me a good amount of pointers as well as giving me some positive feedback on qualities as a potential mentor. This motivated me even more to become a mentor. I attended my first committee meeting and realised that I'm not really used to meetings and am totally unfamiliar with the procedure.</p>
<p>I have also been to a leadership team meeting which actually got me a bit more motivated about being part of the running of the branch but there is a fair amount of work to be done and all of this on top of our listening duties. It's voluntary though so if I do feel that I'm not as motivated as I had expected or that I'm feeling a little overburdened then I can step down and allow another fellow Samaritan to take my place.</p>
<li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
<p>The one-off goal this month is gardening. Now that summer has started everything is growing fast but the council have also started their garden waste collection service so there won't be piles of grass cuttings and branch clippings littering the place. My housemate has some garden goals too so we'll work on them together.</p>
<p>The gardening has gone well. My housemate has been planting beans and has also cleared and cut back overgrown areas. The tomato plants in pots are doing really well and even though there is more to be done I think we are on top of it.</p>
