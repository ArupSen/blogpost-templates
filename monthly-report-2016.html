<p>We start on the 8th of July for the 2nd half of the year. Seems to have gone well in the first half of the year and of course in the latter half I would like to improve upon it. Having said that everything has been going well, the programming and clutter clearing hasn't gone as well as I was hoping.</p>
<p>It's now the 15th of August and obviously very late in terms of completing the report. Other than strength none of the goals were set. It now having been 5-6 weeks since the beginning of July I really have quite forgotten what I had in mind in terms of goals for the month so rather than try to set the goals I will simply write a short account in order to be able to publish the report.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>This goal really seems to have taken centre stage and I really can feel myself getting stronger. The training habit is very much in place and I have just started a new routine this month. Already after a week of following it I can feel that I have made progress so I'm going to need to adjust some of the exercises but other than that the goal is to follow it on the designated days. There is more work on the rings and more static holds. The handstand is now part of the routine which is working better because having it as part of the yoga session meant that it was a bit hit or miss. I've been thinking about joining some sort of online strength training group or program such as the Gold Medal Bodies one. The main reason would be to follow a program that was laid out by experts and also to get support. It's also not overly expensive. But I'm quite happy with my current program so I think I will follow that for the month at least: better not to keep changing things too much.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Diet</h4>
<p>My plan was to find some dishes that would work as evening meals as the breakfast and lunch meal plans have already been set. I think I did that and managed to refrain from snacks but that may have been August.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Yoga practice</h4>
<p>Missing sessions and still doing them while watching TV series. Very distracted and a bit disappointing as I've been trying to find a solution to this for a long time with no avail.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing Clutter</h4>
<p>Seem to have lost touch with this one again.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>Did very well indeed in July and completed my first 600km Audax ride on the 9th. The ride was called The Buzzard and I have written a separate report about it. The weekend following this ride on the 15th I rode a 300km night ride called Hereward the Wake which I rode on fixed gear and counted it as a 200km ride towards my SFW or Super Fixed Wheeler challenge. I had also planned to ride a 200 on the 23rd but even though it had been booked I didn't feel too well when the day arrived.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming</h4>
<p>Not one variable was assigned or a function declared.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>Been very consistent with this one. I renewed by subscription to Type Scout and seem to be steady at 52wpm with a good level of accuracy. I always aim for 100% accuracy when I practice so that I get used to correcting my mistakes and am closer to a real world scenario where I wouldn't actually continue to type should I have made a mistake. On average twice a week but at times I do more than that.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>Even though I haven't been progressing at the rate of one book a month I have been enjoying my reading very much. It's not something that I manage to do every day and my usual reading time is a period just after breakfast. I can't read in the evening because I tend to fall asleep if I try and read but I'm not putting pressure on myself to read more or to read faster.</p>
<li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
<p>On the 18th of the month I took the mentor training session in order to become a mentor and by the end of the month I had been assigned a mentee.</p>
<li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
<p>Don't remember having any particular one-off goals as such. I got excited about doing rollers with a heart rate monitor. I purchased one and then did one session but that was all. The plan was to get up early and do it first thing but that has never actually happened.</p>
</li>
</ul>
