<p>It's May, it's the start of May and I didn't see it coming. I've been pretty engrossed with April and forgot that it was only 30 days long rather than 31.</p>

<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>Having missed Wednesday (today being Friday 1st May) due to working on websites I was looking forward to pushing as hard as I could and also adopting some new ideas into my routine. As it has been going so well this year I've been thinking about taking it a step forwards but also cautious that I don't push too far ahead and lose what I've gained by hitting a wall. I have a <a href="https://github.com/ArupSen/workout" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> for my ongoing workout and today I updated it with a small change. The exercises are much the same as I've been doing for the past few months but I changed the order: I did the hardest ones first and the easiest last. I focused on good form: quality rather than quantity even though the mark of progress is increasing the rep count. In the final set I also do a few negatively emphasised reps to push myself to a deeper level of fatigue in the particular muscle groups involved.</p>

<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>So far this year I've been trying to make progress as well as maintain my level. I certainly have been doing it pretty much every day but there has also been a tinge of disappointment due to the lack of structure and real progress in the same way that I've been enjoying with my cycling or strength training. But the difference is that with those I've been actively working on the progress side of things for the past 2 years or so. The progress orientation is already in place and is an entrenched habit. Not so with yoga and even though I have a rough plan to do more backbends and some other postures that I want to work on this year, when I actually do my practice I find myself doing whatever comes to mind and then feeling that I'm not doing what I ought or that I'm simply wasting my time, especially as I am distracted by watching something while I practice. Listening to something would be better but either way it's a distraction. So it seems that I just want to go through the motions, maintain my level and use it as a time to switch off. What I've decided to do this month then is to practice in a more organic or intuitive way and have no particular goal other than to get on the mat. There is no minimum or maximum duration of the practice time nor are there any particular postures that I need to work on nor is there any stipulation of the level of intensity. I have been questions all of the above and thinking that I need to push harder, longer and work on certain postures. Removing that requirement and lack of clarity allows me to simply feel what should come next, how long to hold it and how hard to push. It will teach me to trust myself and the depth of experience that I have gained from many years of practising yoga and also teaching it professionally. Allowing myself to feel what I should be doing rather than trying to formulate any sort of plan will get me to tap into myself and the teacher that my students respond to.</p>
