  <p>The same ride as I rode last month and for the same reason: RRtY. A ride that I rode earlier this month called the Around Weald Odyssey <a href="link to post"></a> wasn't validated as I wasn't able to collect that final receipt so I asked the organiser what I should do. He suggested that I ride another one just in case. I had my eye on some others but they also require validation by the collection of receipts at the controls. I asked the DIY organiser for the local region about it and he said that it was still work in progress. So at short notice the only way to get my 200 for August was to ride the Boat Trip Perm again as I would be able to validate by GPS.</p>
  <p>The first dilemma was when to do it. The end of the month was approaching and in a way I wanted to have a break from riding. I sought to find a fellow rider who might travel along with me. Luke said that he would join me for at least part of the way but it would have to be over the August Bank Holiday weekend as that was when he would be free. The weather forecast didn't look too promising and the Friday before was actually looking sunny. Maya was away with her grandparents and I wondered if she would be back by Friday which is when I normally see her. But upon inquiry I found that she would not return till Saturday and I could have her Sunday through till Monday. Therefore a Friday ride was possible. It was already Thursday morning when I received this news and I had to go out and teach classes but being a DIY by GPS that I had ridden before and also recently I still had the files on my Garmin and aside from making sure that the batteries were charged and getting up early there was very little other preparation I needed to do.</p>
  <p>Having stayed up late the previous night due to a late shift with the Samaritans I was tired enough to go to bed early and rise at around 05:00. I ate a large bowl of tuna pasta and checked the Garmin. I also packed my saddle bag. That was all. I laid my head down at 22:30 and suddenly sat up a few minutes later when I realised that I hadn't actually booked it. There was a laptop next to my bed and within minutes the ride had been booked.</p>
  <p>The alarm sounded at 04:45 and I got up immediately. I took breakfast of three rounds of toast and made a peanut butter and jam sandwich to take with me as backup food. (The sandwich however never got eaten and still remains in the saddle bag today; Monday.) I had a sound sleep and left the house at 05:45 and made my way to the start in Hillingdon via main roads. The traffic was very quiet at least for most of the way and the smooth road surfaces of main roads meant a fast and easy ride. I arrived in Hillingdon / Uxbridge about 2 hours later and having taken it as easy as possible felt very fresh. It was starting to warm up a little so I removed my jacket and eat one of the bananas that I'd been carrying while I stopped briefly to change the route on my Garmin from the one to get me to the start to one for the actual ride. I knew there were some busy A roads at the start just before Denham Golf Club so I wanted to be past that section before taking a break. But things didn't turn out as I had planned: my first break was fixing a puncture right in the heart of that A road section. I found a driveway just after noticing that telltale squishy feeling. I stopped and before I had had a chance to groan and moan about it I had the bike upside down and my toolset out ready for the repair operation. The sooner it was done the sooner I could be on my way and I could get on with my complaining while I rode. There was a staple that had poked its way into the rear tyre. At first I wondered if the life of the tyre was coming to an end but a breach of that nature was unavoidable. I remember meeting someone on one of the Kent rides who had fitted new tyres and tubes and had had 2 punctures that day. It's as much luck as anything else. In less than 20 minutes I had completed the procedure and took the opportunity to eat a banana. My little hand pump afforded me ample pressure in spite of it being lower than what I could achieve with a track pump.</p>
  <p>Having taken a break and feeling refreshed I decided that I would continue on my way until the first control in Great Kingshill. It isn't necessary to stop at the designated controls riding DIY by GPS but stopping at the controls does give it more of a calendar ride feel and something that is more familiar. It's also an easy way to break up the ride into sections to take food and breaks. The controls also offer the opportunity to purchase food as it cannot be carried for the whole ride. I passed via Denham and Chalfont St. Giles. At the Co-op in Great Kingshill I bought a chocolate chip cookie, a large slice of bread pudding (which gave me a lot of gas later on), a couple of bananas and a bottle of water. I ate most of the food right outside the shop in the small car park. An older gentleman having parked his car and seeing me with my two bananas said that they would keep me going and that they contained plenty of iron. Then I saw two older ladies cycle past and thought I had best be on my way.</p>
  <p>Very soon afterwards I was riding through the grounds of the Waddeston Estate. This estate is like a country park with Waddeston House at the end. A very ornate building. Before leaving I stopped at a corner shop for a chocolate bar and a bottle of water. There was a short queue at the shop and I got rather anxious about my bike being left outside unlocked. I was again soon on my way.</p>
  <p>Next was the rather quaint village of Quainton and the village hall with the sliding doors that was a control on the London-Oxford-London ride. It was getting warmer and the sun had come out but even though I had told myself to take it easy and enjoy the ride, doubt and boredom had started to set in. I wasn't too upset about the puncture and actually proud of myself for having fixed it so calmly. But in spite of the good weather, the great route and also being on good form physically I was full of doubt. Why had I even taken on this RRtY challenge? (Looking at my goals for the year I said that the reason was "why not".) What was I trying to prove and why was I riding when I didn't really want to. Was I done with the whole Audax thing? No, not at all. But it was as though I was no longer riding on my own terms. But having ridden seven in a row towards completing a consecutive set of twelve I was risking all that I had achieved so far and I would be letting myself down from earlier this year and besides, I needed to maintain the callouses on my behind.</p>
  <p>The doubt and lack of motivation was strong but not strong enough to outweigh my will to complete the challenge and my general love of riding, the beauty of the English countryside and the frequent stops to eat whatever I chose.</p>
  <p>The next control was Helmdon and the instructions on the route sheet stated that one should get a packet of crisps or steal a beer mat. In July when I passed the Bell Inn it was closed. But today it was open and even serving a roast dinner. I considered it for a moment as an alternative to the Boat Inn but then decided to be on my way. I don't like pubs and especially not on my own. I got nothing from this control and even though I was collecting receipts as a backup I just wanted to be on my way and get the ride done. Only another 20km or so to the halfway point at the Stoke Bruerne Canal Village. In another hour or so I had arrived.</p>
