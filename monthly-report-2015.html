<p>It's the 5th of September and I feel a bit behind as I'm only starting this months report today and I haven't put out last month's report just yet. But then what does it really matter. I mean it goes on my blog and apart from me there are only a handful of people that read it, if that. But I've been doing it for a long time on a regular basis and it has become a habit and I tend to feel out of sorts if I don't do it. Is it a crutch? Perhaps that's not the best analogy more like healthy food or general training that keeps me on the ball. By writing these reports I look back over the recent past and reflect back to myself how I'm doing.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>August has been carried over into September and my current workout of three supersets is working rather well. I often think back to the days when I could barely do one pull-up and in this workout I'm doing 10 sets of 5 or a total of 50! That is way beyond the expectations I would have had at the time and now it's just normal.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>Having missed reading altogether during the last few days of August and pretty much the first few days of September too I have started up again today on the 7th. Still reading the Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne. The style is very different to any that I have read before but has some allure. I should imagine that I will continue with this till the end, either of the book or the month. I've set a Reading Day for this month on the 16th, something that has been missed many times this year. Hopefully, being on a day following a ride might allow me to just chill out and read.</p>
