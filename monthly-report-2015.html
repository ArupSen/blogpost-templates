<p>Gosh, January flew by and here we are on the 4th of February. Wow. But so far I've already done one audax ride on the 1st. Woo hoo.</p>
<p>It's just about the halfway mark in February (16th) and what I've noticed is that I'm playing catch up in terms of the goals that got neglected in January. I know that cycling is not my only goal but as I've been so focused on it so far I have neglected the others somewhat, which I've mentioned already. I've made an attempt to redress the balance and am trusting that the momentum that I've gained with the cycling will carry itself so to speak. I do want to get to the same level with the programming and reading so I am plugging away. I also don't want to leave out entertainment and to that end I've got myself a Cineworld Unlimited card which I used to have many years ago. I've worked out which days I could see movies, essentially the days that I teach and also when I have Maya so that rather than being at home feeling guilty about watching iPlayer or YouTube when I could be getting stuff done, I take the time to actually make an event of watching a movie in the way that it was intended by the makers. In spite of all the irons that I have in the fire I think I can actually fit this in.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>I have updated my program so that now the rep counts are all a little bit higher and the triceps dips have been replaced by dips between chairs which is a bit harder. Just what I needed. The updated workout is up on my Github in a repo called workout.</p>
<p>On the 11th and the 18th of Feb strength training was missed in place of riding and training which is fine I guess because that's why I'm doing it!</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p>I'm still doing the 5:2 fasting diet and the plan is to continue for the rest of my life. Is it healthy though? I mean my understaning of a healthy diet is one that promotes better functioning of the body and reduces the possiblity of diseases. The evidence to support the fasting regime does show that it does reduce impurities in the blood and on the fasting days because the body doesn't have to process food it goes into repair mode. I also do eat more fruit and vegetables on those days which is good but on my normal eating days I tend to overdose on the junk food. But the balance is slowly tipping and I'm happy with that: an ongoing process of clearing the junk out of my system.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>I haven't had any problems maintaining my practice but if I'm not focused then I don't really add in the new postures that I was going to try and pursue this year. Sometimes I remember just after I have finished the session. I still look forward to my sessions and do think about progress as well as maintenance. But with all the riding I'm doing at the moment it really is more of a recouperative yoga rather than making breakthroughs with difficult postures. Still, having lost so much weight some postures have naturally got a lot easier.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p>Had a brand new bluetooth mouse sitting in the cupboard for at least a year that never got used. Sold it on ebay for &pound;43.00 which was a lot more than I had hoped to get for it. I have also put on a top that I got for xmas last year that is brand new and unused as well as my old iphone 4 now that I have the new iPhone 6.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>As I've mentioned above, on the 1st of February I rode the Windrush Winter Warmup 100km ride in the Cotswolds. I had already ridden it before in 2013 but remember that I found it very tough going at the time and also remember that there were hills to climb.  When I had finished I was quite exhausted and my legs were wobbly when coming down the stairs. However, on this occasion I found it so much easier. In the first instance I was using a GPS device which made the navigation far easier. I did ride the same fixed gear bike but didn't find it in any way a struggle and could easily have ridden further. Initially the weather was looking as though there would be ice and snow but that soon cleared and there was soft winter sunshine pretty much all day. It was indeed cold but certainly bearable. The hardest obstacle was the wind and during the second leg of the ride there were headwinds for all of the 32km. The first leg on the other hand was with a tailwind and like most people I rode a non-stop 47km. There was tea and cake at each stop and no info controls which kept it very simple. The start was at 09:00 and I came in at 14:30 ish. I didn't push it but did try and make the most of the downhill sections in the third leg especially to make up for the tough riding during the second stage. I was staying with friends who live only 10 minutes ride away from the start / finish so went back there for a couple of hours before making my way home: Kemble to London Paddington by train then the final cycle of the day from Paddington home. Felt tired but not all exhausted and hungry for more.</p>
<p>After the audax on the first I didn't do any big rides till the 11th of February. I did a training ride to Brighton and back. It was a cold and cloudy day but there was no rain. I rode fixed again and used a route that I've ridden many times before except for one change which avoided the "offroad" section. I left at around 08:30 and didn't stop till I reached Cuckfield which was about 3 hours ride. I felt so comfortable that I had the crazy idea of riding the whole way without stopping. I checked my phone messages and found that my friend would be available for lunch at 13:00 if I managed to arrive at that time. I ate the peanut butter sandwich that I had packed and set off again. I arrived at 13:03. I caught up with my friends, took lunch and then began the journey home. There was a whole lot of traffic on the return leg which really spoiled the experience. I shan't be doing it again. I was surprised at how easy I found it and wasn't too tired the following day which is a regular yoga teaching day.</p>
<p>Yesterday on the 15th I did another training ride of 136km to Much Hadham and back again in preparation for the Wye Wednesday audax coming up on the 18th. I rode it again on fixed gear even though the initial plan was to ride in Kent on my geared bike. But Diego at Artisan Cycles persuaded me to pay them a visit and discuss some business while I was there. It was a fairly straightforward ride and took about 3 and half hours each way. I stopped for about 2 hours while I was there.  We chatted about forthcoming rides, updating their website and the upgrades that I have planned for my fixed gear bike. I also had time to lace a wheel. I did experience a tiny amount of knee pain in my right knee which was a little worrying but just a niggle. With a day off the bike today and only a commute tomorrow I should be rested enough for Wednesday.</p>
<p>The 2nd 200km ride of the planned run of 12 was completed on Wednesday the 18th as planned. The training that I've been doing really paid off and everything went as planned apart from one thing - a tumble on ice. I got up at 0430 and left the house at 0525 to reach Bromley South station. At the station I met someone that I had seen on the Willy Warmer ride in January. We chatted about audax during the 25 minute journey to Meopham. At Meopham we noticed one or two others and then made the short 5km journey to the Gravesend Cyclopark. We arrived just after 0700 and got ourselves ready by getting our brevet cards but sadly there wasn't the usual abundance of cakes and snacks and the obligatory cups of tea etc. I met another rider that I've met before an previous audaxes and as my rear light wasn't working borrowed one from the guy I had met on the train. The ride was well over subscribed and there were more than a hundred when last year the number of entrants numbered only 40. We split into two groups so that there wasn't a mass exodus. It was cold and there was ice on the roads. Much colder than it was in London. But there was sunshine and only a slight breeze. After a short while we encountered ice across the roads and everyone walked gently till we had passed it. I thought that it was all over as the sun had risen higher into the sky but about 50km into the ride there was another patch which I couldn't see very well. The sun wa reflecting on the road which made it hard to see if the road was simply wet or if there was ice. I noticed one rider in front of me who seemed to be going a bit slower than I wanted to go. At one point I saw him stop and walk carefully. I thought that he was just stopping for a break and thought it was a great opportunity to pass him but the moment I was about to pass it was too late to stop and I slipped onto my left side and skidded to a stop on the ice that was completely across the road. He helped me up and I gradually unclipped my left foot out of the cleat. My left hip, elbow, shoulder and knee had taken an impact and were bruised. I went to the side of the road to recover for a few minutes. A little stretching and rubbing but the main thing was to re-attach my Garmin which had broken one of its straps. I had fastened it to my handlebars with zip ties and luckily (a must have on all audax rides) I had plenty of spares. With the Garmin set up and a quick snack I set off again. I was only bruised and there was only minimal pain but if I did not finish then my February opportunity would be lost. I found that if I kept riding the pain was minimal and my focus shifted away from it and I almost forgot about it.</p>
<p>The weather was gorgeous though for a winters day and I was on very good form. I particularly enjoyed the Romney Marshes section and also the section after sunset where the route moved higher up so that the lights could be seen as well as the motorway. I recognised some of the sections from a previous audax I had ridden in that area called the Hop Garden, especially all the oast houses which are typical of the Kent countryside. I'm planning to ride that one again this year, but this time the 200km one rather than the one hundred. But in spite of the crash I started strong and finished in a similar way. I didn't find any difficult climbs along any part of the route which could be due to the fact that they were all easy or that my fitness level has increased to a point where I don't find them as steep. I did notice one rider walking one climb which I didn't find particularly steep and he had gears while I was riding fixedgear. This was towards the end of the ride which leads me to believe that I have indeed improved my fitness and strength level. It was good to meet a few other riders that I've seen before as well as a whole range from seasoned veterans as well as total noobs. At one point in Hythe cafe I was actually giving advice on how to eat to one rider which he was taking on board. Guess I'm not the noob that I thought I was. Well, it has been two years or so since I started on this audax game. So I can tick Wye Wednesday as done, 2nd 200km of the year done and two more FWC (fixed wheel challenge) points on the card. I remembered to take the card with me this time.</p>

<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p>Having neglected programming pretty much all the way throughout January I aim to get at least a minimal amount of hours. I had a look at my plan for the year and will pick up where I left off in December with the ruby koans, using ruby to solve the CodeEval challenges and generally using ruby for utility apps.</p>
<p>I was thinking of the idea of having a programming day in the same way that I've been having a reading day or a day out on a ride. That day is fully dedicated to that particular activity and currently there is nothing in place for programming.  Would be a good way to boost the hours.</p>
<p>I've also been thinking about a Code School subscription. It's about &pound;190.00 for the year. Not a great deal to spend compared to the &pound;300.00 that I spent on only one term with City University for the Java Programming course that I attended a few years ago. Perhaps putting down some money and subscribing to a course might motivate me to get my programming hat on again.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>The typing hasn't been going well at all in February. It's the 20th today and I've missed it again and unless I keep it in mind I will probably not do it today. I need a strategy, I need a plan. What I'm doing at the moment isn't working but what I did last year did work so perhaps it's a case of going back a few steps in order to go forwards.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>Did the reading day yesterday (9th) and a bit like last month it was a bit distracted. I did manage to do a fair bit of reading but having looked at the actual hours that I logged it was only 2.25 hours of actual reading. This is obviously a lot more than the half an hour a day that is planned for the daily goal but still a lot fewer hours than I had anticipated. But it shows that I hadn't planned well. I did go to the park for half an hour but it was a bit too cold to stay longer. I worked when I got home and then worked in the evening. I think that if I had taken more time to plan then I would have chosen a café to go to and also done it on a day when I would have been home in the evening too. Still, it's a new beginning as I didn't do it at all last year and didn't read at all in the latter half of January.</p>
