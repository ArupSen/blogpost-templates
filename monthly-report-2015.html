<p>It's the 8th of December and I have only just published the monthly report for November so I am feeling a bit behind with things. As I mentioned in that report, one of the things that has delayed many projects is entertainment. As I mentioned in the November report it has been quite guilt free but it still draws time and energy away from other things. Hopefully, I can get the balance right this month.</p>
<p>A very late start indeed on the 15th of December and I haven't set any goals for this month and I'm getting a bit anxious about the plan for next year. I really want to have that ready so that I can hit the ground running but then I do have a fairly good idea of what I want to do and it is much the same as this year. Moving from November to December has been pretty smooth. Knowing that most of the goals are ongoing and that the plan will be much the same next year allows me to think of it more as a long 24 month year rather than a 12 month one: a year is only an arbitrary division of time anyway.</p>
<p>It's now the 24th of December which leaves only one week to go and even though I'm not really doing Christmas as such this year the rest of the country is doing it and therefore December is getting some disruption to its regular routine. I don't have much work in all of my jobs: yoga, wheel building and web development so I am winding down and enjoying some time to think and reflect. I've decided that this year instead of placing the annual review in the same post i.e. this one, the December report, I will create a separate post for it. I'm sure that there will be some overlap but it will help I think to have a space to focus on the entire year rather than both the month and the year.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>I'm very happy with the way this is going so far this month. I've seen good progress on all of the exercises and my stability on the rings has really improved. I thought it would take a lot longer but in just a few short weeks I've moved forward much further than I thought I would. The only changes that I've made this month are use the final sets of my five supersets to work on what I have planned for next year: the muscle-up and the lever. I did experience some minor shoulder pain doing dips on the rings but using strict form I seem to have remedied this. It was a little bit worrying as it could have really broken the flow but I'm being very careful.</p>
<p>Having missed the workout on 22nd of December due to spending the day with Maya and then doing a cut down workout on Christmas Day I changed my workout day from the 28th to the 27th because I wanted to ride and also changed what I've been doing. Not sure if it will be a permanent change but it is in line with my strength training goals for 2016 so I gave it a shot. I basically did straight sets instead of the supersets that I've been doing since the summer. It seems to be in some ways easier and in some ways harder. It's a little less boring because each exercise is only 3 sets and the idea is that you can move to a more difficult exercise once you can do 3 x 8 reps. It comes from a website called <a href="http://www.startbodyweight.com">www.startbodyweight.com</a> and covers most of the exercises that I'm doing at the moment but gives a list of progressions: something that I haven't really been doing aside from using the rings. Actually, that isn't strictly true, I have been increasing the difficulty of the exercises but haven't been as systematic or methodical as I could be I suppose. It's a great site which explains very carefully why he has chosen these specific progressions and how to effectively make progress. He also provides an infographic wall chart in order to easily glance at the whole program and create a workout.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p>One of the ways I've suggested to Maya as a means of eating more healthily is have one day a week as a NO SUGAR day. I think that I need to adopt this strategy myself. But which day? Mondays and Fridays are fasting days so they are already sugar free days. Could it be a weekend? I think, at least as far as I can see at the moment, that I cannot designate a regular day so perhaps it'll have to be one that is set from week to week. That means that there is more chance of it being missed but that is how it'll have to be for now.</p>
<p>I wasn't planning on celebrating Christmas this year but when it came down to what that meant it comprised essentially of eating, lounging around and generally taking a break. There were certain foods that I thought I would miss so I included those and I also changed my fasting days in order to be able to enjoy a little Christmas fare on the day. I did indulge in a little alcohol too but when you consider that my regular consumption amounts to around 1 unit a week on average then 2-3 units on Christmas Day and Boxing Day would be miniscule compared to what most people are consuming. I didn't overindulge on snacks as I have done in previous years and didn't feel the urge to do so.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>I've been enjoying some distraction free yoga i.e. without looking at a screen and I must say it has been quite refreshing. It does raise the importance of my practice rather than it being a stretch session while I watch TV, which obviously makes it clear that the TV is more important than the yoga. One thing I started to notice is that if I watched something short and I then moved my attention away from the screen back to the practice I noticed a sense of focus and engagement and a certain depth that can only be experienced when one is fully focused. The practice itself is still fairly random but at least I'm staying in postures for longer, being sensitive and breathing properly.</p>
<p>In the final week of the year I had a few days when I didn't do any practice at all and there were some days where I did very little aside from my usual stretching while I watch something. I'm sort of half ok and half disappointed with this but as I don't have any clear goal other than getting on the mat and doing something there isn't a way for me to measure how well I did. Doing nothing obviously counts as a fail. Doing a short session also seems to count as a fail so I really think that I need a routine or clear goal to follow otherwise I won't know when I'm falling short.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p>After a short period of being quite systematic with this I seem to have missed a week but it still feels good to have moved a couple of larger items.</p>
<p>In the final week of the month I seem to have given up on this in spite of my database. There is plenty of stuff that needs to go but at the moment I just don't want to concern myself with it.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>On the 2nd of December I rode to Much Hadham. It was the first non-commuting ride that I had ridden since the Audax ride on the 1st of November. I had also planned to ride back as it's only 60km but then felt lazy after our meal and got a lift home. It was however a continuous ride of around 3 hours and I seemed have maintained my fitness level even though I hadn't been riding much. This ride was pretty straight forward and it turned out be a nice day for December.</p>
<p>On the 5th of December I rode the South of Bucks Winter Warmer Audax from Beaconsfield. I have written a separate post about this ride but it was more of mental than a physical challenge. But I have now completed my RRtY challenge. On the one hand it does feel like a big achievement and on the other hand I feel relieved that it's over. Part of me wants to do it all over again and even try a double RRtY as one can ride them in parallel as long as you only count one ride once. I really should do another ride in December but I also want to take a break from it all too.</p>
<p>On Saturday 19th December I rode the Surrey Hills with Luke. It was a dry and mild day with little wind and were it not for this short ride I probably would not have ridden. There were a good amount of climbs and descents which is not something that I relish but I have ridden some tough hilly rides this year so I felt well conditioned and I also wanted to accommodate Luke. It was the route that he had chosen and he was gradually coming back to the saddle after a knee injury. I almost considered riding to the start in Dorking which would have taken me around 2 hours but the route to Dorking would be the same one that I would be taking later that day as I had a Samaritans shift at 10pm. So in the end thought it would be more sociable to take the train with Luke from Wimbledon. We could have a chat and catch up. Luke is a dietician and took the time to answer some questions that I had about my changes to my diet that I had in mind for 2016 and ideas about diet and nutrition during a ride. He took his time and gave me some detailed answers and I now have some guidelines for 2016.</p>
<p>During the ride we stopped for a cafe break in the village of Cranleigh. It was on the route of the Around Weald Odyssey that I rode in August and went to the same cafe that I stopped at with Brad. I got talking to the owner who asked where I had ridden from and I explained that I wasn't with a club as such but was an Audax rider. He said that he would be interested in becoming a control and I gave him the details of the Audax website. The rest of the ride was fairly pleasant even though I didn't really enjoy the hills that much but as it was only a 50km round trip it all seemed to be over before I felt that I had got going. On the train journey home Luke asked me about rides that I had planned for 2016 but having finished RRtY I really had no plans that continued beyond that and so wasn't able to give him any details other than that I would like to ride some of them again. Part of me wants to complete RRtY once again but this time as a double but another part of me is glad that it is all over and I want to be free to choose if and when I ride rather than make such a commitment. It's a good way to keep fit, especially through the winter months and it gets you to ride when you don't feel like it but it does put cycling and riding Audax at the very forefront of all other activities and I don't know if that is a good or bad thing. One calendar and one perm every month perhaps. We shall see.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p>I really seem to have lost interest in programming so far this month but started to look at a course on Code School after some encouragement and prompting from someone at Code School. It feels somehow half hearted and I really don't want to force it if I really don't feel like it and turn it into a chore. So I don't think I'll set myself a goal for this one this month.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>Having set a goal of doing this 2-3 times a week rather than every day I seem to be encouraged to do it again and quite enjoying it too.</p>
<p>Had another session this morning and enjoyed it. Seem to be at an average of 52 wpm with an accuracy of 94%. Good to have a sense of where I am but wonder if I can really improve that much. But if I really don't think that it's possible to improve then why bother? Well, to maintain my current level I guess but if I could improve somewhat then even if I did miss a few sessions I would then drop down to a level that may even be higher than I am at now. For example, if I got my speed up to say 70wpm and then dropped down to 60wpm due to lack of maintenance then it would be still higher than my current level. So if doing 15-20 minutes of practice allows me to achieve that then it surely is worth it.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>Really have no interest other than a fading memory of books that I enjoyed earlier this year. I did choose a book whose name I can't even remember that is a great start and after dipping back into Don Quixote and not finding it very engaging I seem to have given up again. I think it's going to have to be a trashy novel or nothing.</p>
<p>As of the final days of December I still haven't chosen a new book and I haven't been reading so I think it's probably not going to happen. I really am wondering if I should put this one on the list for next year.</p>
<p>I'm in a bit of a dilemma between wanting to read and doing it because it's a good thing to do. Earlier this year I really enjoyed it and found that certain books did have an impact upon me but later in the year totally lost that connection. Now I'm thinking ahead to next year and wondering about perhaps setting a goal of reading the whole of Dickens for example. The new year is approaching and I need to think carefully about this one: don't want to lumber myself with something; even the RRtY got very challenging at one point and I was fairly motivated with that goal.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Entertainment</h4>
<p>My month of Netflix binge watching ended on the 12th of December. I did enjoy it but didn't feel that it was worth the regular payments when they didn't offer content that I wanted and their content also had a life span. I've gone back to 'free' streaming sites and even though the image quality is less than HD it doesn't detract from the enjoyment it provides.</p>
<p>The other form of entertainment that I've been enjoying again is gaming. I bought a few games in the summer but after a month or so stopped playing them. After a recommendation from one of my Samaritan colleagues I purchased a title and have been playing again. I thought about taking my gaming experience a stage further and I've written a post about it this month asking if I should build a gaming PC.</p>
<p>On the Monday before Christmas my lodger went away and left me a lot of his games. I have been playing Halo Reach and a bit of Toy Story 3 with Maya. So really no need for a new gaming console or a gaming PC as there is plenty of mileage left in this one for a good while.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
<p>Met up with those that were in my training group for an early xmas get together. It was great to see them again and feel how far we had all come. At the start there were 14 of us and many had been lost along the way. There were only 5 of us at the meal. I have put myself forward to cover a couple of shifts for xmas eve and boxing day mainly due to people being away. I'm quite looking forward to it as I'm not planning to celebrate as such this year so I guess I'll be taking calls from those that did want to celebrate or spend time with loved ones but couldn't.</p>
<p>I did 4 shifts which were almost in a row: 19, 22, 24 and 26 of December. They weren't as time consuming as I had anticipated nor were they scary but felt quite routine. As I'm recently qualified I feel that I should do as much as I can now while I have the time and while I am motivated in order to hone my skills. Who knows how long it will be before I'm bored of it and decide to take a sabbatical or quit as is my wont with most things.</p>
