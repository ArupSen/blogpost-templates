<p>Day 5 was on Friday 5th June. I missed it on Saturday in order to take it easy prior to the Audax ride on Sunday, so in total 4 days were missed. Monday as a recovery day and then Tuesday mainly due to laziness. Today I set up in the same place as before and set up an online countdown timer in fullscreen which I can see from where I am sitting. The main difference to previous sessions was that today my lodger was home and wanted to see me ride with both hands on the bars. But I felt confident enough from my previous sessions to do this and started immediately holding the bar with both hands. He cheered me on and I rode steadily for 18.5 minutes but probably at a faster pace than usual as I knew he was watching. Glancing at the clock, when I saw that there were 5 minutes remaining I decided to try and ride at a faster cadence ofr 30 seconds or so. It was probably as fast as I could manage without losing my control. I then went into a slower pace to cool down and wondered if using a metronome would help. I was slightly distracted during the cooldown but only slightly.</p>
