<p>It's the 3rd of January and I'm punctually starting the new year. I've written up a review of 2015, set goals for 2016, written a monthly report for December 2015 so I feel up to date and extremely well connected with my goals and blogging about them. The plan this year is to look at the list for the year and then set a smaller goal for the month which takes a step towards the goal of the year. The effect of this means that not only am I reading the goals for the year at the end of the month prior to the review but I am also looking at it at the start of the month to decide what I'll be working on that month. I have a good feeling about 2016: I feel more confident because I know what I want, what I'm capable of and made plenty of room for faffage.</p>
<p>Now at week three on the 20th of January and I'm finding it hard to get myself out of holiday mode. I'm getting things done and generally progressing with things but feel as though I am not. Perhaps it's because I don't have much work at the moment. One of my yoga clients was away till the 11th and I have only had a minimal amount of website work. The same for wheels so it's been a guilt free leisure time. Sometimes I have felt that I should be doing more in terms of my goals but I have been achieving what I had set out to achieve so there has been absolutely no reason to give myself a hard time as I normally do. It's a situation that I've always wanted: minimal work, pursuing my goals and plenty of time for leisure but I seem to find it a little odd; guess I thought that it wouldn't ever happen.</p>
<p>It's now the 26th and the final week of the month. I'm looking at the goals that I set at the beginning of the month and wondering how I'm doing. Some things are going really well, some things are going OK and some things are not going well at all. The tax return still hasn't been submitted even though I was planning to get it done earlier but this is always the way. Overall I'm feeling happy with my life and general progress.</p>
<p>The 31st and thus the very last day of the month and I'm feeling very happy with my progress and the fact that I have kept in touch with my original principles of aiming to marry together the lazy and the industrious. The tax return hung over me for most of the month and I managed to complete it with only 2 days remaining. However, the stress and pressure that it has caused in previous years was far greater than it was on this occasion and thus did not detract from allowing me to enjoy other activities. In fact it helped me to accomplish many things that I would normally avoid. For example I would look through my list for the day and work on anything that wasn't to do with the tax return. So there was indeed an upside to leaving it so late.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>The workout for this month is already set which is essentially a continuation from the final weeks of December where I switched from doing supersets to straight sets. Today (3rd January) I have set out the actual workout which I did on Friday 1st January. It's already on my workout repo on GitHub so I'm ready for this one.</p>
<p>When I upgraded all of the exercises for January some of them just seemed impossible but over the course of the month I have been gradually getting to grips with them. For example I could barely hold myself in the front tuck lever position let alone attempt a rowing movement but now I am able to perform six reps. It's very encouraging and seeing the progress helps me to enjoy it even more.</p>
<p>During my final workout of January on the 29th I made some short video clips of myself during some of the sets in order to assess my form and I am happy to report that I was quite pleased with what I saw.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Diet</h4>
<p>The goal for this month is to find one meal that I would like to eat on a regular basis which could also be made into a frozen meal. Some previous ideas have been chicken and sweet potato as well as tuna and sweet potato fish cakes. But it doesn't have to be these. As well as coming up with an idea see if you like it and try freezing portions.</p>
<p>So far I have only come up with the idea of Chicken Tuesday. I'm trying to eat more protein so I've been cooking chicken drumsticks in the oven on Tuesdays, the day after my fast. About half a kilo is enough for two meals. It doesn't cater for the grazing issue but it's a move in the right direction.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Yoga practice</h4>
<p>Make the free-form aspect of the practice truly free-form in that there is no prescription and no particular list of requirements other than to get on the mat and do some yoga. As for the handstand find a suitable progression and assess which stage of said progression would be the right place to start.</p>
<p>After a few sessions where I was very focused I seem to have gone back to the distracted practice again but at least I am continuing with it.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing Clutter</h4>
<p>Have a look through the db and update it as required. Put handlebars on eBay and Martina's laptop. Get an idea of how long it would take to discard all items that are not borderline.</p>
<p>So far I haven't had a look at the db and seem to find the whole idea a bit of a chore but still feel like I want to do it. It's as though I want to get rid of it all in one go rather than do it step by step.</p>
<p>I do feel somewhat disappointed with this my performance with this goal or rather my estimation of it. Due to the number of items that need to be discarded has been sufficiently reduced and make it more difficult to choose what should be next it wasn't the fact that I didn't accrue a high number in terms of what was thrown out but rather that I didn't think it was important as an exercise. When I saw the reminder on Friday morning I simply made a mental note and continued with my other activities and to all intents and purposes put it off.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>Book on the Willy Warmer ride. Set a date for doing a perm. Set a date for a ride with Luke or Junior. Set a training ride date. Set days for roller sessions. Intervals on Thursday.</p>
<p>As soon as I returned home from my Samaritans shift on 4th January I got straight on the rollers and found it really hard. I noticed that I had no trouble with the balance and felt confident but maintaining a steady rhythm did feel like hard work and I didn't do any "rev outs". The session lasted only 19 minutes by which time I had had enough. I'm sure that a few regular sessions will get me back in top form.</p>
<p>On the 16th I rode the Willy Warmer which didn't warm my willy at all, in fact quite the opposite but you can find more details in a separate report. I've set a date to ride with Junior as there was rain on a date we had set previously. I've been on the rollers a couple of times and have been doing ad hoc intervals on Thursdays. I also have a date for second long ride. I'm partly into the idea of riding a double parallel RRtY but also want to have a break from it all. But if I am going to do it then at some point I will need to ride the winter months so as I said to myself last year I should get it out of the way sooner rather than later and to that end I'm riding another one in January. The weather promises to be warmer on the 25th.</p>
<p>Yesterday on the 25th the weather was fairly pleasant so I took the opportunity to get out and ride a 200km perm. It was the one that I rode in October last year with some minor changes. I had forgotten how hilly it was but it seems that my fitness has improved a lot because in spite of the lack of training between rides I did pretty well and most of all really enjoyed myself. There will be a separate report to cover this ride.</p>
<p>On the 27th, only 2 days after my 200km perm I went on another ride albeit shorter with a friend. This friend has been riding regularly over the past month building up his fitness and using my very first fixed gear bike and was keen to ride with me after hearing about all the riding that I do. It was a dull grey day but fairly mild but then it started to rain and as the rain grew heavier the wind grew stronger. Nevertheless we both thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming</h4>
<p>Choose a course for January from Code School and set sessions for the week. The sessions don't need to be long. They could be an 1 hour 3-4 times a week along with some Code Eval and YouTube follow ups.</p>
<p>I've completed the course called the Magical Marvels of MongoDB and created a mongo database for my words.</p>
<p>I didn't really follow up the MongoDB course other than watch some videos: I already feel that I have forgotten most of it. Since then I've been doing a few Code Eval challenges and have started on a Git tutorial with Codecademy.</p>
<p>I feel as though I have forgotten a lot of what I have been learning and some of the courses that I worked on last year such as the Regular Expressions one and even much of the SQL one even though that was only last autumn. I'm finding it hard to recall what I studied earlier in the year last year let alone the content. I think a good amount of refresher courses are required.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>It would be better if the 2-3 times per week were always the same days but that isn't always possible. I'm thinking Tuesday and Thursday as I don't workout on those days so there are fewer items on the list.</p>
<p>By looking at the Scout Mode page on Type Scout I can see that I've been doing it about twice a week or just under. I still haven't set any days as such so I think that would be the next thing to do. I find it's a good idea to do it just before I'm about to write: a load of emails or blogging.</p>
<p>Looking at Type Scout I can see when I did some practice and this month on the 8th, the 12th and today being the 28th: that is a lot less than 2-3 times a week. I really do need to set regular days or it is just not going to happen. Provisionally I have Thursday and Sunday evening and I have one set of those before January is over.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>The list for the year has already been made and I have already made a start on the Pickwick Papers so it's just a case of reading a chapter or two of the book each day.</p>
<p>On the Kindle the progress is given as a percentage and if there are 30 days in the month then I need to read 3-4% in order to complete the book by the end of the month. But what if I fall behind? At first I thought I would have to catch up so that I could be back to 3-4% a day but all I need to do is to divide the remaining percentage by the remaining number of days. For example, at the moment on the 20th I have 52% remaining and 11 days which gives me 4.7% per day rather than reading 8% in order to continue with 3%. If I did want to make it up then that could be the object of my Reading Day rather than number of hours as such.</p>
<p>Since my last comment about reading I haven't progressed very far so I still have 50% remaining which means that I need to read around 9% each day if I am to complete the book by the end of the month and start the next one. Definitely enjoying the book and enjoying reading itself but obviously not reading enough to make the amount of progress that I had anticipated.</p>
<p>It's is now the final weekend of the month and I have 37% remaining. I have no engagements or deadlines and therefore it is theoretically possible to complete the book if I dedicate the entire weekend to it or at least a better part of it.</p>
<p>Even though I did manage to read a bit more than 4% yesterday I completed nowhere near the 18% if I was going to split that 37% over two days, therefore on the final day of the month with only 3 hours of the day remaining I still have about 30% left to read. I can't see me completing the book today and don't want to use up all of my time doing just that but hopefully I'll spend another hour or so and finish it tomorrow which would be February.</p>
<li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
<p>Yesterday, 4th January was my first shift of the year. It was a day shift and my plan was to focus on SMS calls and then move on to phone calls. But there were no messages in the queue and when I had set myself up to take phone calls I didn't receive any for a good while so decided to move on to email callers. Still being new I needed the help of my duty partner to pick up on what was said in the email. It was quite an eye opener. I would have come across as dismissive had I sent my original response without the helpful revisions. It showed me that I still have a lot to learn.</p>
<p>On the 20th I did an overnight shift and seemed relatively well recovered after my ride on the 16th. I was in good spirits and maintained good energy throughout the night. As it was Tuesday morning from 01:00 to 07:00 I was still fasting and in some ways I think this helped with my concentration.</p>
<li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
<p>Although my one-off goals so far are to find a job and work on my web service, I think that for January the most urgent goal would be to start, complete and submit my self-assessment tax return. It doesn't take long and I leave it till the last minute each year and it looks as though this year in spite of saying that I wouldn't I have done the same again.</p>
<p>I seem to be leaving my tax return till the very last minute once again: on the 20th of January with only 11 days remaining I have only just made a start.</p>
<p>Today is the 30th of January and I have finally completed my tax return. As expected it took very little time and makes me wonder why I had not completed it much earlier and dispensed myself of the pressure I had suffered for the whole of January: why do I torture myself in this way year after year? Could I possibly complete it in April this year instead?</p>
<p>I have been thinking about some other one-off goals such as looking for a job and building a wheel tracking app but they have remained as ideas rather than actions. I did of course allow myself to do this due to the fact that I was working on the tax return but working on the tax return was essentially avoiding the tax return.</p>
