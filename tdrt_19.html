<p>After using all my strength trying to prise a sprocket off a hub I found myself getting very hot and my lodger having just left for the track in Herne Hill I decided that as I had forgone an Audax ride today I ought to get on the rollers. So I did. I was set up in no time at all and felt very steady from the get go. In fact it felt like I was riding on the road. I had my hair tied up in a bun but had forgotten to put on a hat or anything to catch the sweat which started to appear soon after my first "rev out". I noticed that my Cateye speedo started working with the dynamo light turned off. Having that was almost like having a cadence counter as I riding fixed gear. Kept it at a steady 29km/h and aimed for 45km/h during the 30 second high speed spin. I managed it on the 2nd spin and reached 44.4 on the third attempt. The sweat was pouring off me today and I managed to keep the bike very steady even though I was removing my hands from the bars frequently to wipe it away.</p>
<p>Even though I am not riding the rollers as often as I would have liked the 30 days continues with 11 remaining. I seem to have settled on a routine and I haven't got bored of it yet. But today's level of steadiness has shown me that I should perhaps try some drills such as single leg pedalling. I wasn't confident enough to try it today but I did at least let one foot grow loose and carry the pedal stroke as far as possible with the other foot. There was an initial judder which I had to conpensate by pedalling more smoothly. I'm keen to try this and actually remove one foot entirely. Perhaps during the next session.</p>
