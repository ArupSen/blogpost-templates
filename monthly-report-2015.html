<p>The start of April and I'm not really with it due to finishing the end of last month spending time in bed ill and now gradually recovering. It's also Easter time and the days that I take Maya have changed or rather that I'm not seeing her over the Easter weekend which again makes things appear odd as seeing Maya is such a regular feature in my life. But in that sense it's a break, a time to stop and reflect.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>The first week has been a recovery week with zero on the first day, then a cut down session on the 2nd and then sub-maximal on the third i.e. not able to reach the rep counts that I have been reaching recently. Shows how hard the illness hit me.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>During the few days of my illness I practiced yoga in bed which I thought was commendable given my general lack of energy. This shows that I am indeed motivated.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I've started reading The Time Machine by H G Wells and since it is a short work I think that I should be able to complete it well inside the month time frame and also complete my other choice of Three Men in a Boat. I think I have already mentioned these books in my previous report but I'm excited at the thought of actually catching up to my one book a month goal. Of the ones that have been lacking this is really picking up again and I hope to do some audio book recordingt his month too.</p>
