<p>During May and June of 2015 I revived my interest in fountain pens. I've always had two of them one of which I use on a regular basis since I received it as a gift. But I only continued to use it because it was a gift but didn't actually like it as a writing instrument. Nevertheless, I used it for writing my "morning pages" for 7-8 years. It didn't get used for anything else. Meanwhile the other one which was meant to be an everyday note taking pen which was more enjoyable as a writing instrument always seemed to be dry so instead of using that I deferred to roller ball pens.</p>
<p>I wanted two things or rather two pens: one that would be more comfortable as writing instrument
for my <em>morning pages</em> and would also be more legible and also a different one that would be my everyday note taking pen. My first stop was to start with research.</p>
