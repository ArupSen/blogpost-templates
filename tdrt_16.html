<p>A good few days have elapsed between Tuesday and today, Sunday, that I almost missed the session.A late evening session at around 20:30 and this time in the corridor near the front door. I mounted and almost immediately got into a steady rhythm. I set the timer for 20 mins and my plan was to "rev out" as my lodger calls it at 15, 10 and 5 minutes for up to 30 seconds. I did exactly that and really went all out to just about bouncing on the saddle. I feel so little anxiety about falling off that any amount of swaying in the rear wheel didn't worry me in the least and I was able to increase the revolutions to a rate that is probably as high as they reach on the road. But it is a little frustrating that I cannot see an actual cadence value. I think I will need to get some sort of measuring device.</p>
