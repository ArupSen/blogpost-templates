<p>More than a week since I had been on the rollers, not since my Dunwich Dynamo ride. I rode for about 2 minutes and found it extremely hard to turn the pedals: the tyre pressure was low. I got off and pumped it up hard. Now I was whizzing around. I did my three "rev outs" at 15, 10 and 5 minutes to go but the final few minutes were tough. I couldn't tell if it was because I was tired in general or that the tyre had deflated during the session. When I finished I squeezed it between my fingers and it felt firm but then I can't tell psi by hand.</p>
<p>I felt very comfortable and balanced today. I sometimes came close to the edge with no fear of falling. It was a hot summer evening and I was drenched with sweat even though I was wearing only shorts and shoes and my cap to prevent the sweat from trickling into my eyes.</p>
