<p>It's the 5th of September and I feel a bit behind as I'm only starting this months report today and I haven't put out last month's report just yet. But then what does it really matter. I mean it goes on my blog and apart from me there are only a handful of people that read it, if that. But I've been doing it for a long time on a regular basis and it has become a habit and I tend to feel out of sorts if I don't do it. Is it a crutch? Perhaps that's not the best analogy more like healthy food or general training that keeps me on the ball. By writing these reports I look back over the recent past and reflect back to myself how I'm doing.</p>
