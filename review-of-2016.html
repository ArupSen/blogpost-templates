<p>This year, 2015 has been an excellent year and has been as close to a perfect year as I could have imagined. Yes, I could do better, one can always do better and that is what I will aim for in 2016 but compared to previous years it really has been magnificent. I've kept up all of my practices and routines for the better part of the whole year and not only that, I have had a heartfelt connection to them all. The sentiment that captures it best is that I want what I have. I wouldn't have had it any other way. Things just sort of fell into place and I had to do little or nothing to keep it all going. This reassurance that the routines were established and that I could rely on them to stay in place allowed me to build upon what I already had. This really was the biggest difference between this year and previous years: I wasn't in the process of continually rebuilding foundations that kept crumbling repeatedly. The flagship of all of my goals this year was the RRtY challenge in Audax and all other goals and even work was put aside in order that this goal was achieved. It showed me how to remain focused for the entire year and that I was capable of far more than I thought possible.</p>
<p>Aside from my goals I have achieved some other things this year. Keeping up with the RRtY challenge and taking on the Samaritans training after summer I realised that I needed to make some changes to my lifestyle and finally take the plunge and quit one of my yoga classes: something that I had been thinking about the previous year but could not justify it as there would a loss of income. But it was a great relief to actually go ahead and do it. A lot time was freed up because even though it was only one class which lasted 90 minutes it took me around 2 hours in commuting time. I used to leave the house at 12:20 and would return home at around 16:20 if I stopped at the shops on the way home. That was four hours out of my day and it was right in the middle of the day and so made it difficult to do anything else that day. It also really broke up my week. Not only did I gain the whole day but also days in a row. As well the money lost I also considered the cycling time I would lose and yoga practice but a few weeks after quitting I never missed it and never thought about it again.</p>
<p>One thing that characterised the years activities was the logging of hours. I logged hours for cycling, entertainment, programming, reading and yoga. It started with keeping account of hours on the bike so that I would fulfil the recommended 10-14 hours each week. I limited it to quarter hour intervals rather than making it more precise and timing every activity with a stopwatch but nonetheless I found myself watching the clock rather a lot. I continued with this form of record keeping right up until the final two weeks of the year when I decided that it wasn't an exercise that I would carry forward and other than showing me what I already knew about the extent of my efforts in those activities the data serves no great purpose. I cycled for 611 hours, practiced yoga for 333 hours, programmed for 183 hours, read for 114 hours and spent 547 hours engaged in entertainment. The 611 hours of course includes my long rides but still gives me an average weekly total of 11 hours which is inside the 10-14 hour requirement. Looking back I can remember going on many rides both Audax and other ones but when it is averaged in this way 11 hours a week doesn't seem very much at all when you consider that an average 9-5 worker riding 2 hours each day and then long rides at the weekend would ride more than this but still I'm quite impressed by my efforts and fairly happy with the results. But I spent almost an equal amount on entertainment which shows how much of that I need. I only practiced half as much yoga but the amount of programming is rather disappointing: 3 hours a week. I really would have liked and hoped that I had achieved more than this. The hours even included working hours as well as purely study hours. Other than disappointment it makes me wonder at how interested I really am in the subject when I am prepared to pursue it for only 3 hours a week.</p>
<p>This brings me to the feeling of disappointment itself. My attention seems to move quickly away from celebrating success such as with my RRtY to dwelling upon the fact that I failed at my attempts at programming. What went wrong? Why was there so little passion when I believe it to be much stronger? Is it something that I feel I should want but don't really want? When things go well obviously there is no problem and doesn't require this level of thought: whatever I did with my cycling worked well and requires no further thought; I achieved what I set out to achieve. But how come I didn't achieve it with programming? But wouldn't it be a better idea to explore why I did so well with my cycling? Why was I prepared to sacrifice so many other things in order to pursue it? Perhaps answers to these questions could help me to understand what I lacked in my programming efforts. But focusing on my failures rather than my successes seems to my wont. Is this a bad thing? I seem to think so and believe that it would be better to alter ones focus towards ones strengths and ones successes without ignoring the failures but shift the focus in order that it be weighted more toward the positive.</p>

  <li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
    <p>Something that started life as a training supplement to my cycling that became a separate entity in itself. In the early part of the year the session comprised of max sets and it lasted only 15-20 minutes. I was happy just to maintain a regular practice and didn't want to start a weight training regime as I had followed during my teens and early twenties. But when I discussed my efforts with a friend he said that he had been focusing much of his efforts on bodyweight training and suggested that I watch a few videos to get an idea of how he had been training. It didn't take me long before I was watching more of these videos and wondering if I could take my training to another level. I picked a beginner routine from one of these channels and adapted it to work with what I had already been doing. The session expanded from 15 minutes twice and possibly a third time to around 45 minutes and a definite thrice weekly workout. Later on in the year, early autumn I guess I purchased a set of gymnastic rings to allow me to work on exercises that I wanted to perform but that would have required more equipment. The rings are very versatile in that they allow many different exercises to be carried out and at the same time build core strength and stability. As well as building strength it feels like more of a holistic approach i.e. using the whole body and gives a sense of a connection to something that has been tried and tested i.e. nothing new or gimmicky such as kettle bells or clubs.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Healthier Diet</h4>
    <p>My main dietary practice has been the 5:2 fasting diet and in July I passed the one year mark. It doesn't feel like an achievement as such because I tend to just keep going with it and because I've adopted it as a lifestyle choice rather than something that I'm doing for a certain period of time it is just how I eat or rather don't eat as it were. The initial drive for this was to lose bodyfat which of course I did but on my non-fasting days I got into the habit of eating a lot of junk food because I was allowed. I thought this would be fine for a short time but after a year I thought perhaps it might me an idea to address nutrition as well as purely weight loss. As summer drew to a close and I was getting more into strength training it was that which prompted me to think about the general quality of my nutrition. On my cycle rides I eat pretty much whatever I like because it's low intensity and other than indigestion it's essentially about getting enough fuel into the system on a regular basis as the rides are very long. But when it came to muscle building everything pointed to protein. I started with adjusting the junk food by having chicken and chips rather than sausage and chips. Then I changed the breakfast on my non-fasting days. I've been having toast for breakfast for many many years and almost overnight I changed from that to porridge and eggs. It somehow felt very natural and psychologically didn't feel like much of a change at all. I used to avoid porridge in the past because I used to get really hungry immediately after eating it but perhaps due to having protein with it or due to intermittent fasting for over a year it didn't have that effect any more. This led me to come up with my idea of the 21 meals. I know that if I was a fully fledged bodybuilder I would be having six meals a day or whatever but I don't want to go down that road as I have mentioned in the strength training section but this is more of a nod towards it. I do want to build muscle and I want to improve my nutrition so this goes hand in hand. I have a means of reducing the amount of junk food that I eat, continue with my 5:2 intermittent fasting diet and work towards eating more lean protein and vegetables.</p>

  <li><h4>Daily Yoga practice</h4>
    <p>I think that I did have some plan at the start of the year such as following one of my clients routines and using a timer to get me to stay in postures for longer. I liked this sometimes but not at others and then decided to drop it and use my time on the mat as a free form and organic time because all of my other goals were so structured and planned out. This worked well and got me engaged with the practice but soon I found myself watching things while I was practicing. When I'm listening to things such as a radio programme or a podcast I don't need to look at the screen so could still focus quite effectively on the yoga but once I started watching videos the focus clearly wasn't the same. At first it was programming tutorials on YouTube and I justified it by telling myself that it was educational and that as well as doing yoga I was also lairing at the same time. However, this was a slippery slope and soon I was watching TV series and movies. Sometimes I felt disappointed with this but only sometimes. Most of the time I felt good that I was maintaining a regular practice even if it was distracted because I had spent months in the past where it was more like my programming is right now in that I had bursts rather than a steady consistent and regular practice. Out of a month I would say I missed three days on average and this was due to being genuinely busy or ill rather than just skipping it because I didn't feel like doing it. This is one reason I decided not to make it more structured and kill it.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Clearing Clutter</h4>
    <p>I had periods over the year when I was very consistent with this and periods when I didn't do it at all. Later on in the year I created a database to keep track of what I wanted to discard and how that happened in the end. This was at the time when I was enthused about creating databases so that enthusiasm bled over into the clearing of clutter which was great. I feel that I made good inroad into the total amount of what I would consider clutter but also managed to unearth other items which perhaps were outside my radar. Having a regular weekly reminder to throw something out each week was still quite effective but over the course of the year I found that I seem to work in bursts rather than in a steady and consistent manner. That's not a bad thing but I seem disappointed by it. The end result is the same but I think I would have preferred it if I did it in a more systematic way. I suppose that during the lapses I feel as though I've lost it and it won't come back again because some things don't.</p>

  <li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
    <p>RRtY or Randonneur Round the Year was my main goal of 2015. It was a challenge that I thought would push me to my limit and it certainly did that. It challenged both body and mind. First of all it was mainly body in that I hadn't been riding much over the previous year and had ridden only one 200km ride. RRtY requires that each ride should be 200km or more and they also needed to be twelve consecutive rides. After the first ride in January I slept for 14 hours straight. By the third ride I was getting used to rising early in the morning and I was recovering faster. As well as the RRtY challenge I wanted to ride my first 300km ride which I did in April. This was also a night ride and so it was killing two birds with one stone. I fared better than I thought I would and over the course of the year rode another 3 x 300km distances. As July approached I had a month where I couldn't ride any that were on the Audax calendar so rode what is called a perm or Permanent ride which means choosing a date and riding it solo. I did this again in October but this time created a ride of my own but made it official. This is something that has been on my Audax to do list but being under pressure to ride I went through all the digital paperwork and got it done. In August I rode a very challenging hilly ride called Greenwich Mean Climb. It was the hardest ride I've ever been on but at the same time very rewarding to know that I was able to complete it. This again was due to RRtY: normally I avoid hilly rides but as there were no other calendar rides I could enter I decided to do it. For the same reason I rode another hilly one in November; this time a 200km ride but with just as much of a challenge.</p>
    <p>But I'm very happy with my year of Audax and the completion of RRtY which I thought wouldn't happen at some points when the pressure was strong and I wanted to quit. After an initial physical challenge it became largely a mental one. It was a great confidence boost to know that I could just get on my bike and ride a 200 or 300km distance without any doubt. In spite of the pressure I am still glad that I did it and that I stuck with it to the end. It was good to be so focused on one thing through the whole year and to have one goal that stood above all of the others. Aside from a few moments of boredom and doubt I have really enjoyed my riding this year and everything related to it such as studying maps and working out schedules etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
    <p>I've blown hot and cold with this for the past few years and this year was no different but due to my main goal of riding RRtY this goal was very much sidelined. I did have spans of weeks at a time when I did work on my programming but it was very erratic and not very systematic at all. When I did it I did enjoy it, apart from when I had to do it which was mainly client work. Doing Code Eval was a lot of fun and I used both Ruby and Javascript to solve the challenges. After a long gap of no programming at all and no real thought of doing it I did a course on Code School called Breaking The Ice with Regular Expressions. I've tried to learn Reg Ex many times but didn't grasp the fundamentals fully or just lost touch with what I had learned very soon afterwards. This course made it a lot of fun and also cleared up a few fundamental concepts that had eluded me before. I began to use them in my programming and they didn't seem as cryptic or strange as they had seemed in the past.</p>
    <p>At this time Code School were offering a special discount if you signed up for a year and as it was quite a substantial discount and there was a course that I wanted to study at the time I enrolled. One of my Samaritan colleagues wanted to know about databases so I suggested a couple of courses for them. Then I realised that I hadn't studied those courses myself so I decided to do so. One was with Code School and the other was with CodeCademy. I enjoyed these so much that even though I hadn't set learning databases as a goal I went with it anyway as I was enjoying it so much. This was through October and November but as December began I lost touch with programming again.</p>
    <p>At the start of the year I was carrying over my study of Ruby which I think continued till the end of January then I had burst of functional programming especially after understanding blocks with Ruby and then spending a good amount of time studying functional Javascript. I also studied Vim and Git but again very much on a whim: there was no real plan as such; I continued until my interest had dwindled away.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Typing</h4>
    <p>Not much to say about this one really. Very much ongoing in spite of many lapses over the year. The initial plan was to do it every day but just for 15 minutes or so but it just didn't happen. But I found that picking it up now and again worked really well so I decided that setting a goal of doing it 2-3 times a week would be ideal and in December that is what I did and I started to enjoy it again.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Reading</h4>
    <p>I started the year strong with my reading goal this year and this continued through till late summer when I began to struggle with the idea. I went from so called high brow books over to more low brow just to keep going with it but in November and December totally lost touch with it and even considered giving it up altogether. But when I looked back over the earlier part of the year and remembered how much I had enjoyed being part of an authors world and how much influence those books had had upon me I decided that this was a keeper. Here are some of the titles that I read this year: The Scarlet Letter; Walden; Three Men in Boat; The Time Machine; Gulliver's Travels and Moby Dick. I must also mention three Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child which were 61 Hours, The Affair and Worth Dying For. These were enjoyable but didn't touch me as deeply as the others.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
    <p>After watching a BBC documentary about suicide I was inspired to do something about it. Normally such programmes have a fleeting effect upon me but this time it caused me to act. I believe that this was partly due to the fact that my life is going well and that I have everything that I want from life and am in a position to give something back to the world. I believe that without this sense of contentment I wouldn't have even considered it.</p>
    <p>It was a long training process comprising firstly of an introductory information evening and then 9 sessions of what they call Initial Training which had to taken in one pass i.e. without any breaks. This involved a lot of juggling of timetables with my ex-wife and rearranging childcare etc. It also impacted upon my bike ride schedule which was the main goal of the year. After those first nine sessions there were six mentoring sessions which involved taking real calls but supervised by a mentor. Once that was completed we then had what was called Commitment where we got our Samaritan number and access to the centre. There then followed four more Initial Training sessions the last of which was in early December. I'm now on probation until early April 2016.</p>
    <p>In spite of the lengthy training process and the shifts that I've done as a fully fledged Samaritan I feel that the journey has just begun. It's a bit like passing your driving test and then actually get out on the road.</p>
  </li>
  <li><h4>Entertainment</h4>
    <p>Not exactly set as a goal but I wanted to mention entertainment especially as it did take up a good amount of time and I have mentioned it sometimes in my monthly reports. One of the strategies that I thought about at the start of the year was to make movie watching an event in itself and take myself to the cinema. To this end I purchased a Cineworld Unlimited card which would allow me to watch as many movies as I wanted for a year. This was partly to stop me feeling guilty when I did watch movies at home and also to be able to focus more fully when watching a film. But it was to allow me to focus on other things when I was home such as reading or programming but that didn't really happen. Sometimes I would come home after watching a movie and then spend time watching TV series or gaming. At first I thought that I'd just shot myself in the foot by doubling my entertainment rather than taking it away from home but it showed me how important entertainment is to me. I need to make room for it otherwise I seem to take it by force and my fragile goals are just brushed off the table.</p>
    <p>As the year progressed I watched a good amount of TV series and movies at home as well as gaming on the Xbox. Later on in the year, after summer I think it was, I began to embrace it and started to feel less guilty about it as I accepted it as part of who I am and that I need to make room for it as well as other aspects of my life. I even went the other way and spent the better part of November trying out Netflix. I thought that if I was going to do this then why not do it in style but Netflix didn't offer what I wanted: they were not a library or archive and their content did expire. I wasn't prepared to pay for that no matter how good the picture quality. By the end of the year I also decided that I wouldn't be renewing my Cineworld Unlimited card as the movies on offer were not often ones that I wanted to watch and the ones that I did want to watch didn't remain on release for long enough and were not being screened at a time that suited me. I also needed to combine my visits to the movies with already being in town and since I was only doing that once a week effectively it didn't seem worthwhile in terms of the amount that I was paying each month. They also didn't offer any discount for a one-off annual payment. One thing it did prompt me to do was to go on father and daughter dates but that would have worked out cheaper if I had paid the full ticket price each time as I wasn't using my card much after the summer i.e. not really breaking even. So I can keep going on these dates next year without feeling that I'm paying extra.</p>
