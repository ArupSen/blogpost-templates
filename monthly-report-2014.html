<p>It's coming to the end of August and even though I have only written one report this year, the 6 month report, I feel like I want to write something this month. August has been a quiet month work wise which has meant that I've had ample time to focus on my projects.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Working out</h4>
<p>I've been working out pretty consistently throughout August. It's still my short 15 minute session 3 times per week. But I have also been making some steady gains as well as maintenance. Mondays and Fridays have become my regular weekly fasting days and the workout falls on those days but that hasn't had an impact upon performance in any way. If anything performance has improved. I have lost a little weight which means that there is less weight to lift in a chin up. I've finally reached 10 reps in the natural grip pull up. At one point I could barely manage three reps and wondered if I would ever reach five. But some consistency was all that was required. There is still some disbelief when I do it and when I do it it's a case of proving it to myself again: "Here, look, I'm doing this right now."</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p>What is a healthier diet? More of the good stuff and less of the bad stuff. But why is this better? It improves well being, increases the efficiency of the body, helps to prevent disease and keeps energy levels steady. But I'm a big fan of junk food. A friend of mine has alerted me to the 5:2 and it involves eating normally for five days of the week and then fasting for two of them. The fasting days involve eating a minimal amount of calories but the idea is to change the body chemistry so that the body goes into repair mode. There is no food for the body to process so it can get on with the job of repairing damage, recovering from exercise etc. Recent studies have shown that regular fasting can help with anti-aging. There is also a great deal of fat loss due to the low calorie intake. It's a flexible regimen and the two fasting days can be moved around the week as required. So far I have been enjoying the fasting days very much. Having debunked the pre-conceptions of feeling weak or feeling hungry or having very little energy I find that I don't experience much hunger at all, my energy is very consistent throughout the day and I have a little extra time because I'm not cooking and eating lunch. It also saves me money and I seem to eat a bit less on the non-fasting days. It's only been a few weeks but I have lost a few kg already. I don't plan to be stick thin but I do want to lose the love handles. I'm going to carry on with two fast days a week till they have gone and then switch to only one fast day a week.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>I have been practicing yoga at home on each of the days that I don't teach. I'm really pleased with this but I still sense a little disappointment in the background. What I'm pleased about is that I have been very consistent and focus what is required that day and tailor the session as required. My disappointment is that I'm not at the level I was when I was at my peak. That was the early nineties and I had a daily practice which lasted around two and half hours. I was making good progress but lacked the understanding that I have now. Twenty years of teaching has shown me that in order to sustain a consistent daily practice and integrate it into ones work / life balance the session needs to adapt accordingly and that one cannot simply follow a plan rigidly. If I had made yoga my main career that may have been possible but that wasn't the case. Even when I was teaching yoga full time I still wanted to do something else so it has been a struggle to keep it going. The disappointment stems from the thinking about what could have been. But in fact could not have been because I didn't want it. So my practice is more about maintenance, health and well being which keeps my current level but doesn't take me into the more advanced postures. But having been through a period where I was struggling to do any practice outside of my teaching to now practicing every day is good progress so I'm choosing to focus on that achievement rather than what could have been.</p>

<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p>Every Friday at 09:00 is when the reminder sounds for me to think about clutter. In my Evernote I have a Notebook called de-clutter which contains a list for each room of the flat of candidates that could be discarded or sold. For most of August I have simply ignored the reminder. I have trimmed down my possessions so much that it's getting hard to decide on what should go but there are still many items that could go. Do I miss any of the items that I've discarded? Nope.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax</h4>
<p>My goal this year has been to ride 2 audaxes per month. This month I rode a mid-week Audax in and around Maidenhead on the 13th. That brings my total this year to seven. Given that I started the season quite late this year I think this isn't too bad. There are still a few days left of August and I may possibly ride another one this Sunday on the 31st.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Bike training</h4>
<p>My original plan of doing one long ride, one hilly ride and one fast ride still remains on the list of to do items but there doesn't seem to have been enough enthusiasm and motivation to actually follow it through. For a couple of weeks I did start doing intervals during my commute on Thursdays but I haven't really been systematic in this regard. Now that I have seen the evidence for doing regular HIIT it does make sense to make it part of my regular schedule. I have been thinking about investing in a turbo trainer or rollers especially now that we are coming to the end of summer and I am concerned about maintaining my fitness over the winter months but my fear is that such an item would only become a dust magnet.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p>Along with yoga here is another one with which I seem to have a love / hate relationship. I decided to throw myself into the study of Javascript in February but soon put it to one side when I was distracted. Now it is through the distraction that I have come back to it. When browsing YouTube one of the recommended videos was a showcase of the features of a client side Javascript framework called Angular.js. After I watched this video I was hooked. I followed the tutorial on their site, did the tutorial on Code School and am now embarking upon another tutorial. Along with this I have been working on my Vim skills, Tmux, Git and as I mentioned with the typing tweaking my level of customisation of my computer working environment so that I can be as mouse free as possible. I seem to be spending more and more time in the terminal even use a command line app to access my Evernote.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>I've started doing my typing exercises again! I've found an online service called Type Scout which can be seen here - <a href="http://www.typescout.net">www.typescout.net</a>. I looked around for a few and looked again at one that I used to use called web typing but noticed that I didn't like it so much any more. Type Scout has a game like feel to it and has various challenge modes. It's great fun and they also have leader boards. I don't take much notice of these but it's quite nice to see your name come up in the top 10 every now and then. I've gone right back to the start to revise the basics and iron out any kinks that may persist at that level. There is great support for Dvorak. I've been doing around 15 minutes a day and have been doing it every day. I paid for one year membership which was only $12.00 which is extremely good value so this will keep me at it for a year I hope. Going very well so far and I seem to be consolidating what I have. As well as this I've been learning more and more keyboard shortcuts on every app that I use in order to maintain a keyboard focus and minimise use of the mouse which is obviously a lot faster and a whole lot more productive.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>This month I read the George Orwell classic, 1984. I've read some of this other works in the past but not this one. It's easy to see how influential it has been and how it has spawned many other dystopian works based on the same totalitarian ideas. Chilled me to the bone and left me slightly trembling at the end. I haven't been doing very much on the reading of public domain books on librivox.org but did complete the two chapters of Norse mythology that I had claimed just inside the deadline.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Staying in touch with friends</h4>
<p>I've been very organic with this one. This month in particular I been focused on immersing myself in my projects and goals rather than trying to maintain any kind of social life. I wouldn't consider myself an asocial person but this month at least I have preferred to focus on projects over people.</p>
