<p>It's May, it's the start of May and I didn't see it coming. I've been pretty engrossed with April and forgot that it was only 30 days long rather than 31.</p>
<p>It's now the 6th of May which means a week has almost passed and I'm feeling behind. I am feeling that I am already in catch up mode and that it will take me probably till the end of the month till I have actually caught up. Last night I went to the Samaritans information evening and even though it was interesting and inspiring they do require a good amount hours of commitment and given the amount of stuff that I want to get done this year I wonder if I will find the time and end up getting nothing at all done. In spite of the slight anxiety I am feeling somewhat confident and positive. Not sure where that is coming from but it's there.</p>
<p>It's the 12th of May and this month's 200 ride is done. That means I can get on with wheel building and website building work which has been building up steadily. I have a plan to try and get the website work out of the way by the end of May and it looks as though if I do focus then I could actually do it. The wheel clients on the other hand are fairly laid back so if things become a little bit delayed then they don't mind too much. I've also had another new plan / idea which I'm really excited about and is sort of medium to long term. I call it "Long Weekend Every Weekend". If I can pack my working hours for all the paid work that I do into three days i.e. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday then my weekend can start on Friday and end on Monday evening a bit like an Easter weekend. I've done some initial calculations and given that I can live quite frugally I think it's a possibility. I think it will help me to keep the work and leisure days separate and rather than having every day as a hybrid work / leisure day it may be mentally / psychologically easier to dedicate one day to one thing. It may even make it easier for me to fully embrace the Reading or Programming day which I find difficult at the moment.</p>

<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>Having missed Wednesday (today being Friday 1st May) due to working on websites I was looking forward to pushing as hard as I could and also adopting some new ideas into my routine. As it has been going so well this year I've been thinking about taking it a step forwards but also cautious that I don't push too far ahead and lose what I've gained by hitting a wall. I have a <a href="https://github.com/ArupSen/workout" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> for my ongoing workout and today I updated it with a small change. The exercises are much the same as I've been doing for the past few months but I changed the order: I did the hardest ones first and the easiest last. I focused on good form: quality rather than quantity even though the mark of progress is increasing the rep count. In the final set I also do a few negatively emphasised reps to push myself to a deeper level of fatigue in the particular muscle groups involved.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>So far this year I've been trying to make progress as well as maintain my level. I certainly have been doing it pretty much every day but there has also been a tinge of disappointment due to the lack of structure and real progress in the same way that I've been enjoying with my cycling or strength training. But the difference is that with those I've been actively working on the progress side of things for the past 2 years or so. The progress orientation is already in place and is an entrenched habit. Not so with yoga and even though I have a rough plan to do more backbends and some other postures that I want to work on this year, when I actually do my practice I find myself doing whatever comes to mind and then feeling that I'm not doing what I ought or that I'm simply wasting my time, especially as I am distracted by watching something while I practice. Listening to something would be better but either way it's a distraction. So it seems that I just want to go through the motions, maintain my level and use it as a time to switch off. What I've decided to do this month then is to practice in a more organic or intuitive way and have no particular goal other than to get on the mat. There is no minimum or maximum duration of the practice time nor are there any particular postures that I need to work on nor is there any stipulation of the level of intensity. I have been questions all of the above and thinking that I need to push harder, longer and work on certain postures. Removing that requirement and lack of clarity allows me to simply feel what should come next, how long to hold it and how hard to push. It will teach me to trust myself and the depth of experience that I have gained from many years of practising yoga and also teaching it professionally. Allowing myself to feel what I should be doing rather than trying to formulate any sort of plan will get me to tap into myself and the teacher that my students respond to.</p>

<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p>I had pile of clothes which I had set aside as pending but that was almost a year ago. On Saturday (9th) I put most of these clothes into a carrier bag and today(Monday 11th) I took them to a local charity shop. They were pleased to accept them and it looked as though they took other items apart from clothes as donations. There are many items that I haven't discarded because I believe that they will fetch a good price on eBay. But listing on eBay requires time and effort not to mention having to go to the post office. As far as I can see the larger items that would have fetched a sum to cover my efforts of listing them on eBay have already been sold but because I did gain a certain amount of revenue I still believe that I can do the same with the items that remain. Due to this belief they continue to remain. The deep fat fryer is one such item so I will take it to the charity shop when I next get the opportunity.</p>

<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>On the 10th of May I'm planning to ride a 200km audax called the Hop Garden. It starts from a village in Kent called Meopham and as it starts at 08:00 and it being a Sunday there are no trains that are early enough to get me to the start on time. I rode out to Ruislip for the London Oxford London ride so I thought I would do the same for this forthcoming ride. Today (Saturday 2nd) I rode to Meopham as a training ride and of course rode back. It's 34km from my house and it took 1h 45mins to get there. That means I'll need to leave just before 06:00 on the Sunday in order to get there in time for some tea and cake before the start of the actual ride. I plotted the route using <a href="http://cyclestreets.net" target="_blank">cyclestreets.net</a> which took me via small backstreets, B-roads and country lanes. It was a very nice route which took me past great swathes of yellow rape fields with warm hazy sunshine falling upon my face. There was a gentle headwind but nothing too difficult. I rode it more or less without a break. I stopped in Meopham to set the route back and then take a photo of the Meopham sign. The ride back started with a long descent which was fairly gentle but lasted more than 10km. I know I will enjoy this at the end of my 200km ride should I decide not to get the train. This was also the first time that I had used my Garmin since the ride to Much Hadham earlier this week when I experienced freezes and slow screen redraws but having cleared the tracklog and turned off the track recording the device performed as smoothly as it ever did in the past. When I got home I felt very fresh as though I had only ridden around the block rather than 70km. I felt very pleased with myself and my level of fitness. I didn't even stop to take any food during the ride but made up for that later on.</p>
<p>Yesterday on the 10th of May I rode the Hop Garden 200 audax as well as riding to and from the event to make it just over 280km. But I almost didn't ride. I've been bunged up with a cold since Wednesday but in spite of all the symptoms my motivation to ride didn't wane. I had undertaken a good amount of preparation: creating a route to and from the event as well as testing it out, creating a .gpx file from the route sheet and having booked the event so therefore didn't want to lose the opportunity. With RRtY in the back of my mind I wondered that if should miss this ride whether I would get the opportunity to ride another this month. The weather was also predicted to be pleasant. I went to bed early on Saturday evening behaving as though I would ride and set up my bike in readiness.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning at 05:00 I didn't feel particularly good but I noticed that my motivation was still high. I left the house at 05:50 and set off along the route that I had used the previous week to Meopham. I arrived at 07:35 and got my brevet card and the mandatory cup of tea along with as many biscuits I could hold in my hand. I met a wheel building client who was also riding with a friend and said that they would be using the .gpx file that I had created. After chatting to them I took some paracetamol and noticed that the weather was warming up: no need for the soft shell. I set off at the rear of the pack at 08:05 feeling pleasantly comfortable on the bike and noticed that I less I thought about my cold the better I felt. I focused on the pleasant country surroundings, the warmth of the sun and the swathes of bluebells in the woods and rape in the fields. But I wasn't able to keep the cold out of my mind for too long and after a cough or a sniff I was dwelling on it again. On the one hand it was a great route with excellent views and a good amount of sunshine and only a slight wind (although on Romney Marshes I did face some stronger winds) but on the other hand I just felt that I wanted to get it done and go home and lie down. I thought I should take it easy as I was tired but that meant it would take longer to get home. The dilemma was a difficult one. As well as having to deal with boredom and tiredness I also encountered a sense of inadequacy in my speed. Having become more comfortable at this distance after first only just about being able to complete it I suppose I now want to complete it in a faster time especially now that I know that I am capable of riding a distance of 200km in 8h 40mins on good roads. These thoughts niggled at me and the fact that I couldn't go faster than I was going got me a little frustrated which was partly due to having a cold and partly due the fact that I never train for speed. What I've noticed in the past is that when I put in a lot of effort to increase my speed those that seem to be riding at a similar speed tend to catch me very soon which means that a massive increase of effort only gives me an overall gain of say 5 minutes. On shorter event this might be a worthwhile gain but on such a long distance event it's the average overall speed that counts rather than a few peaks so the extra effort which is highly taxing doesn't really help much. It was a good mental exercise to keep focusing on the positive and enjoying the food at the cafés. The first of which was the Kent Gliding Club. I had a cup of tea and spongecake here and generally allowed myself a little longer at stops rather than my usual strategy of taking more numerous breaks but making them shorter. I wanted to treat myself at the café stops to keep myself in good spirits as even if I did manage to complete the ride more quickly that I usually did it would still be a good number of hours. The next stop was the Light Railway Café in Hythe at 83km which was kind of the lunch stop and I arrived here at 12:45. Rather than 'bounce' the control I decided to take my time and eat a good meal so got myself sausage, egg and chips. I didn't rush this nor did I lounge.</p>
<p>As the ride continued and the weather continued to improve I found it harder to enjoy it due to my boredom and frustration even though in terms of fitness I felt on good form. Part of my frustration arose from the experienced older riders passing me and not being able to pass them in return. Audax is more about distance rather than speed and this was the first time that speed was an issue. I'm usually happy to complete the ride inside of allocated the maximum time without any concern of improving my speed and it was one of the reasons I chose audax as opposed to other forms of organised rides but it has crept into my psyche at some point.</p>
<p>When I finally arrived at the finish I did a lot of coughing and sniffing followed by taking some food. I calculated that if I took the train I would only save a few minutes over riding back. As it turned out it was about half an hour but I had the added satisfaction of having ridden home as well as riding to the start which changed the focus back to distance again.</p>

<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p>This weekend on the 9th of May I decided to have a programming day. As has been the case with previous programming days the focus was to clock at least six hours. Once again I didn't quite manage that so I think I will assign another day this month and rather than try and do six hours again just try and make up the shortfall. On this occasion I managed about 2 and half hours and was very happy with that especially as it was a day prior to a ride and I have a good deal of pressure from work deadlines. But I was able to put all of this to one side and focus. I'm currently focusing on tools as opposed to programming itself such as Vim, Git and TDD or Test Driven Development.I still find it hard to focus with impending deadlines looming but I am determined to get them done by the end of the month so that I can spend more time on pure study.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>Post ride day, feeling a little wiped out I took the deck chair into the garden as it was sunny and read my book. But before I did that I turned off my phone. No, I didn't put it on silent, I turned it off. That felt like such a relief. No alerts or reminders or messages or me checking for them if they aren't there: now I could focus myself entirely on my book, which is what I did. I read for a couple of hours and then took a walk to the high street to drop off some old clothes. When I got back I read a little more but didn't fulfil my six hour quota and got into writing my blog (this) and doing a little internet research. As with the programming day I'll assign another day for reading and make up the shortfall rather than try to do a full day. It seems that the six hours is still proving quite a challenge. I thought that it would only be slightly challenging but 3 hours seems to be the norm so far. It seems to work with cycling so perhaps the strategy should be to get away from home although yesterday I was a bit too tired for that.</p>

<li><h4>Samaritans</h4></li>
<p>Last month I mentioned that having watched a BBC Panorama programme about suicide I was moved to take action and decided to take a look at a voluntary organisation called the Samaritans. I contacted them and filled out an application form and last night (5th of May) went to an information evening. We were shown a short video and then given a presentation about how it all works followed by questions. It's definitely something that I could do but they do require quite a large time commitment and the training is nine weeks and you are required to complete all of the modules in one sweep. Some of the training days fall on Saturdays which are either ride days or days spent with Maya so I will need to think about whether I am able to commit that amount of time. As well as seeing Maya and going on rides I also have a plan of doing more programming so even though this is a great idea in principle and would certainly be a case of following my heart it would conflict with many of my goals. Perhaps I could do it all and perhaps undertaking this training could help me to manage my time even better than I do now.</p>
