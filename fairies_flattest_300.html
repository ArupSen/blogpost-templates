<p>Having ridden my first 300 in April 2015 and getting comfortable at the 200 I thought I would have a go at another 300. When I first saw it on the audax calendar I wondered if it would fit into my calendar espcially as I am doing the Samaritans Initial Training at the moment but the timing was perfect. I also wanted to ride it fixed gear especially as the route was flat but was concerned about doing it on my temporary bike due to my Racer Rosa bike not being ready in time.</p>
<p>The ride was from Bethersden near Ashford and started at 02:00 on a Sunday which is effectively Saturday night and that meant it would be no problem getting a train. It's usually quite difficult to get a train early on a Sunday morning so I was pleased by this.</p>
<p>I had booked it well in advance and had received the email about the route and logistics. I had assumed that the message contained a downloadable .gpx file so had left it all till the last minute. I read the message properly at Saturday lunchtime and found that it only contained a route sheet, which meant that if I wanted a .gpx file I would have to create my own and that meant also that I had no time to waste. I had also wanted to take a nap so time was of the essence. In addition to this I needed to create routes to the station. It took me the better part of 3 hours and I also managed to sleep a good long time from 3-6 pm. I felt ready.</p>
<p>I ate a large bowl of pasta and having already moved my saddle bag the previous day I proceeded to do a little yoga at 10pm. I would get the train from Orpington to Pluckley and the ride would take an hour according to my usual speed. I allowed more time but even though I pootled along I arrived early. Very little traffic. Ample time to buy a ticket but the machine was out of order. I wandered around outside the station as I was worried but then decided to stand on the platform as the barrier was open. I met another rider on the platform but after exchanging our hellos no conversation ensued. At 00:06 the train arrived. I waited for the conductor to ask for my ticket and offer to pay but he simply walked by.</p>
<p>Pluckley is one of those tiny country stations so I had travelled without paying a fare. Fair enough. The ride to the village hall took all of 15 minutes and I was warmly greeted. There were around 40 riders for the 300 and many had travelled by car. It was only just after 01:00 so there was plenty of time. Tea and biscuits and a few hellos.</p>
<p>The route was a 100km loop back to the start all on main roads which are of course deserted at night. When I saw this in the email I had my doubts but when we rode it I thought it made total sense. Empty roads, good surfaces and also wide with easy turns. A few very minor climbs but there was a bit of a Westerly breeze. I managed to stay with the leading group for a good while but soon got dropped. No matter. I didn't want to burn out in the early stages. We traversed a sleepy Kent coast riding to Folkestone and returning alongside the sea wall. The halfway control was in a car park next to the sea wall and climbing the steps I could see the sea. The sun was just starting to rise and leaving the control we were into the Romney Marshes. The area is so flat it's ideal for riding fixed gear and the views were spectacular with the first rays of sunlight. It was a warm night and I had to remove my soft shell jacket. I was back at the hall around 06:15 which is probably as fast as I have ever ridden 100km. A hearty bacon sandwich and a good amount of biscuits was consumed. Half an hour later at 06:45 I started on the 200.</p>
<p>There were many rides that day. In addition to the 300 there was also a 200, 150, 100 and even a 50. Brad and Luke were planning to ride the 100km but that was starting at 09:00 so there was little chance of me seeing them. Unless I was very fast and they very slow. But those riding the 200 would be following the same route and I imagined that at some point they would catch me.</p>
<p>The 200km ride traversed much the same areas as we had covered during the first 100 but this time on country lanes.</p>
<p>[A week having now elapsed since I began to write this report the story has lost its freshness and many of the details forgotten. I therefore ask the reader to be lenient when judging the brevity of the remainder of it.]</p>
<p>Having past a couple of info controls there was a manned control in a small church hall. Two old men stood waiting outside the entrance inquiring if we should be riding the audax. They were friendly and inviting and ushered me indoors to see tables full of cakes, biscuits and sandwiches as well as teas and coffees. Only a handful of other riders were enjoying the hospitality of the womens institute and I joined them for my customary 15 minutes. Although I ate a lot it seemed but little in my belly but it would have been foolish to sit down and fill it with many miles yet to ride.</p>
<p>I set off once more being waved off by the cordial gentlemen on the tail of a rather portly Canadian rider. I mention the corpulence of the rider not to insult him but to make a general remark that on this and on many other rides I have noticed rather rotund middle aged riders clearly overweight but in no way lacking in fitness. Most of them were also able to hold a pace far faster than I could ever reach. This time last year I was much heavier and indeed considered myself fat but in comparison to some of these larger riders I would be rather slim. One would be mistaken in this instance in making a generalisation that fat was equivalent to unfit.</p>
<p>We kept leap frogging each other and made some comments about the very unpleasant headwind. Soon after this the tiredness began to strike both in terms of the drowsiness and as a lack of motivation and loss of power. It was around the 180km mark and lasted till the 200. This wasn't something that I welcomed but I had indeed been expecting it. The next control came just in time and helped me to recover and ride on with renewed vigour.</p>
<p>Just prior to this control I rode down a cul-de-sac as it was marked so on the map but on arrival found only a field of horses at the end of it. But I then followed the road into the woods and saw a van parked with 2 ladies seated behind it with the tell tale table full of snacks. They were listening to Radio 4 and chatting away as one would on a Sunday. I took a cup of tea and having got my card stamped proceeded to devour as many cakes, biscuits and sausage rolls as I could without becoming overly distended. It was approaching midday and as I had been expecting, a rider on the 200km stopped behind me. He rolled a cigarette and was impressed that I was riding fixed. I was impressed at his speed.</p>
<p>There being no toilet facilities at this control I decided to move on swiftly to find a suitable gap in the trees. Mr. 200 rider noticed me emerging from this seclusion and waved with a knowing smile. I didn't see him again until I was almost at the end and he clearly on his way home. He attempted to play down his speed but he was indeed a fast rider.</p>
<p>The next section of the route made its way to Dungeness via Lydd and with some strong headwinds and sidewinds it was quite a struggle to reach the cafe opposite the lighthouse. Remembering that I had been weak leading up to the previous control I tried to caution myself about pushing on and that perhaps I should stop and rest. But I felt on good form and had a sense that I would be able to continue without taking any break. The cafe was full and I was sure there would a long wait for food. I got my brevet card stamped, ate a snickers bar and got back on my bike. I would have a tailwind and I could take short break at the next info control.</p>
<p>It was further than I thought but I remained on good form as I rode along the coast road back to the marshes. There were holiday homes and sunbleached signs that looked as though they hadn't been maintained since the 70's. It was around 16:00 now and I was calculating times and distances. The final manned stop would be the Light Railway Cafe in Hythe. It was due to close at 17:00. I should make it.This would be my third visit to that place this year. I remembered the meal that I had eaten on the Hop Garden ride. I wondered what I would have this time. When I arrived the place looked empty with the staff sitting at one table eating ice lollies. Sadly they were no longer making food to order so I had to settle for a ready made cheese sandwich. I took my time eating it and checked my messages and of course got my stamp. I adhered to my 20 minute rule and was on my way once more.</p>
<p>After the unpleasantness of the headwinds I now faced a stretch of untarmacked cycle path also used by other cyclists, dog walkers and people out for a stroll on a Sunday. It was the final section and it had been a gorgeous day with some spectacular views. No mishaps had occurred and I was still on good form: if I let the poor quality of the road surface get me down then that feeling would probably stay with me well after I was on tarmac again. I reflected on this and allowed the time it required to cross the section safely. I think I would have preferred to have ridden on roads and there was nothing in the rule books to prevent me from doing so but too late in the day to do so. I didn't stop again and got back to the Bethersden Village Hall at 17:20. By the time I got my card stamped it was 17:23. Much faster than I had anticipated and the actual distance being 313km. There was food available and plenty to be had. Others were arriving as I sipped my tea. By the time I had finished my refreshments I checked the train times from Pluckley: they were leaving at 41 minutes past the hour. It was 17:39. I would have to wait an hour. Almost. Better to wait there than at the station although I was itching to get away.</p>
<p>I finally took my leave at 18:20 and suddenly got anxious about missing it. However, I put on a spurt and arrived in good time. No ticket machine and hence no ticket. Once again I travelled without paying. It was still warm, bright and sunny as I cycled home from Orpington. I rode through parks and backroads that I had never seen before. I felt tired but not at all exhausted. 350 in all including the transit rides. Home in one piece and having enjoyed myself thoroughly I treated myself to a kebab and chips. I would definitely do this ride again.</p>
