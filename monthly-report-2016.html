<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>Continue with January workout as it seems to be progressing quite well.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Diet</h4>
<p>See if the 'Chicken Tuesday' idea can be developed into a batch meal with other components. Freeze a meal and then defrost that meal and eat it at some point preferably when you have those times of grazing and feeling lazy about cooking.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Yoga practice</h4>
<p>Create a routine and set one session per week as a session where a routine is followed rather than free form and with no distractions.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing Clutter</h4>
<p>Set aside a time to think about clutter clearing rather than defer the reminder. One pomodoro unit perhaps.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>Set dates to ride two perms: the Ditchling Devil and the Boat Trip. Arrange a day to ride to Much Hadham and ride the potential Artisan Audax.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming</h4>
<p>Finish the Git course on Codecademy and then follow up with the courses on Code School.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>Type Scout exercises on Thursday and Sunday evenings as a minimum requirement with any more as a bonus.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>Finish Pickwick Papers and make a start on (and hopefully complete) Oliver Twist.</p>
<li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
<p></p>
<li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
<p>I believe in my idea of the wheel tracking web service but do other wheel builders? I need to ascertain this before I start work on it. This month do some customer research and see how much it is really wanted.</p>
</li>
