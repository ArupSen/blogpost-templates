<p>Remember, remember the 5th of November. Well, that's today and I feel stoked that I have already ticked off my November Audax ride which I rode on Sunday 1st. I do feel a little behind in some things though and as I haven't yet finished my report for October I feel that I may end up writing things that I wanted to say in that report rather than look ahead to the month ahead. One of the new things that I launched in last months report was that as well as tracking goals I was going to use the report at least at the start of the month to set goals just for that particular month.</p>
<p>I spent most of the week after my big ride of the month lazing about and recovering. Not that I didn't do any work but allowed myself to put my feet up. On Saturday the 7th I watched a lot of TV (I call it TV even though it's not live TV but in that it involves sitting and watching a screen) and didn't feel too disappointed with myself. There was a small amount but not the usual level of guilt and despair that I've failed my life as it were. I saw that whatever activities we engage in during this very short life of ours should be fun and engaging rather than forced or regimented: after all, these are the principles upon which I base my goals; they should be fueled by passion and by fun.</p>
<p>It's now the 15th and halfway through the month and it feels a little bit like last month in that it feels like the month is running away without a real chance to set specific goals for the month and then keep up with the reporting. One thing I should mention is that there has been an increase in entertainment. I've added a new section under that heading just to go into detail about it as it seems to be becoming a feature.</p>
<p>One more week to go and in terms of actual overall performance I am doing rather well but instead of feeling good about it I feel a little disappointed with myself. I've been looking at why this might be the case. As well as the clearly defined goal (especially now that I set them at the start of the month) there seems to be what might be called a 'shadow goal'. For example with my dietary intake I have been considering the idea of minimising sugar and flour from my diet. This is a massive undertaking in that most desserts and treats comprise of these two ingredients. But so far it is only an idea. If I were to set it as an actual goal I would need to consider all the implications and set out a plan of action for a whole year. However, the fact that I even thought about it seems to have set it on some level. So even though this month my actual goal for diet is to eat a little more protein and one portion of fruit or veg a day, I also need to avoid sugar and flour. It's not possible without any strategy in place but having eaten a pizza on Saturday I felt as though I had failed. I'm not entirely sure why I felt this or why I felt it so strongly but the feeling was there. It's as though part of me chooses to focus on what I have missed rather than what I have hit. I realised that I tend to do this with all of my goals and that because I gradually do turn ideas into goals, even though this one hasn't yet been set as a formal goal I have still set it as such on some level and therefore am trying to hit that target.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>I have been progressing really well and I have been increasing all of my reps with the routine that I started in the summer. I have been setting some goals for next year but I have been getting distracted by size and appearance rather than fitness and strength. The workout started life as a supplement to bike training and has grown into a project in itself and I seem to have embraced the bar calisthenics / street workout philosophy of training. The goals for next year are to be able to perform a 'muscle-up' movement as well as a free standing handstand and a movement called a lever. The thing about increasing reps is that it makes the session a lot longer so what I need to do is to change the exercises to make them harder ones and also ones that will lead towards the goals for next year: no reason why I shouldn't start working on them already; the year marker is an arbitrary one after all.</p>
<p>Earlier this week on Wednesday 11th November I received a set of wooden gymnastic rings. After considering a few ideas of either adding a garden pull up bar or a pull up bar in the hallway, I still needed a way of doing dips. For a few workouts I started to do them in between my kitchen counters but found them a bit too wide and this was worrying in terms of injury prevention. A couple of friends recommended gymnastic rings and did a few searches on Google and YouTube to get a better idea on well they would serve me. The reviews looked very positive and loved the idea of them being flexible and allowing many different exercises to be performed as well as staying true to the bodyweight exercise format. In addition to be able to perform all of the exercises in my current routine I would be able to purchase them cheaply (these were just over 20 GBP including delivery) and also work on my core strength which was one of the main reasons that I started on this path. Having opened the box I set up the rings very easily and swapped out some of the exercises from my current routine for versions with rings. I found my first experience of them to be highly enjoyable but very challenging at the same time. All the ring versions of the exercises were a lot more difficult but at the same time very rewarding. On Friday 13th November I used them again but swapped out even more of the exercises and pushed myself even harder. I was surprised at how quickly my stability had increased. It's possible to hang the rings from any stable overhead supporting structure. I used my pull up bar but I was considering using the branch of a tree when the weather gets warmer again and I am feeling brave.</p>

<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p>The goal for October was to add extra protein to the diet and eat a little more veg. I failed on the veg front but did make it a new habit to change my breakfast from toast to porridge and eggs, at least on the days that I don't fast. That's five days a week, which is a significant change. On the fasting days of course for the evening meal I do eat veg so that's already two days out of seven taken care of so for this month I'm going to aim low: rather than shoot for 3 portions a day I'm going to aim for one a day. I know that I could aim for two a day as there isn't really much of an opportunity for breakfast but I think that the way I seem to work is to take things a step at a time and establish myself at that level before taking another step. I've noticed this is my way of progress from the cycling. Others can take a leap forward, fall and try again at that bigger step but I prefer not to fall but to make sure that I can make that step rather than a big jump. It takes me a long time to recover if I fall so I try to avoid it.</p>
<p>Even though I mentioned that I felt a bit disappointed with my performance I have actually been doing quite well. The change from toast to porridge and eggs for breakfast is starting to take root and ties in very well with my goal of eating more protein, cutting back on flour and sugar and adopting a plan that I can probably maintain for the rest of my life. This was the criteria when I was thinking about the 5:2 fasting diet. Another approach that I have had in terms of tackling my diet was to think of it as 21 meals. Two days out of the week are taken up with fasting which immediately removes six out of the 21 leaving 15. The porridge and eggs for breakfast takes away another 5 leaving only 10 to consider. I don't want to plan all of those 10 meals in order to allow myself a few treats. During my first year of the 5:2 diet regime I have been enjoying a good amount of junk food on my non-fasting days: probably overindulging. I do love the freedom that this brings but is not a way of eating that I want to continue indefinitely and is not great for my health long term. For these 10 remaining meals then I want strike a balance between healthy eating such as lean protein, vegetables and good fats along with the opportunity to eat a little of what I fancy. Staying with the idea of a meal count I don't know how many should be given over to healthy eating and how many to pure indulgence. I need to cater for both my urges and find a ratio that could be maintained easily without any sort of reaction. One of occasions where I tend to eat junk food is when I don't have anything healthy prepared and came up with the idea of batch cooking or some sort of meal plan. Some plans are already in place such as scrambled eggs or hard boiled eggs and green beans on Monday and Friday evenings. All I need to do is to come up with a meal that is one I eat on a Sunday for example. But as I said, it's a plan that I want to be able to pursue for a very long time rather than something that I can maintain for a week and then quit. So if I bring it in gradually but manage to establish it then all to the good.</p>

<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>What I'd like to do this month is to create a sequence and then follow it. I sort of have a sequence in that I tend to work on certain postures but it needs to be more definitive a bit like my strength training routine. I'm a bit more lax with yoga so if I happen to change things a little that's OK but it would be good to have a clearer idea of a routine at least for this month.</p>
<p>What's happened with my yoga is that it has become a way of logging something else other than entertainment when I want to watch TV. I essentially do a few stretches while watching TV (YouTube or other streaming services) which is very distracting and doesn't allow me to focus fully on the practice. That's how it has been so far this month and I do postures that allow me to stay facing the screen. It's a struggle between maintenance and progress. There is enough of an urge to maintain my practice and by the same token I continue to teach a few classes but I don't really have the drive to take it any further. I do have the occasional burst lasting a day or two but that's all.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p>As I'm still a bit disappointed with my performance on this one and often lose track with what I have that needs to be discarded or is perhaps a candidate my plan is to create a database especially as I have been studying them recently.</p>
<p>I have created a database for clearing clutter and have added items that definitely need to go and others that I'm not sure about. I've put a few things on ebay and simply marking items as candidates for clutter clearing gives me an idea of how much clutter I really have here. Every now and again I find something that was stashed away but was found to be useful at a much later date. However, this is rarely the case.</p>
<p>I posted a couple of things that I sold on ebay today (23rd) and have updated my clutter clearing database. It's great to have that list of items in front of me and be able to pick one that I want to tackle next.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>I have already ridden my 200km ride for this month and it has been validated which means that my goal of RRtY is almost complete and there is no pressure on me to ride again this month. But as with the strength training I already have goals for next year which is to ride a 400 and a 600 km distance. I need to maintain my fitness and take it up a notch.</p>
<p>One thing the RRtY has taught me is how to ride when I don't want to ride due to having a goal for the year. I was wondering if I should aim for something like this for my other goals. I'm also affiliated to a group and the challenge is something that I can share with that group. I think I need something like this for my programming as it's very much stop and start.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p>I think the plan is to run with the enthusiasm that I have for databases until it dries up and go back to Javascript.</p>
<p>There is still a little bit of career development or enhancement tied up with my programming studies and I think that is where the pressure comes from when I have time to work on it but don't. As I've mentioned in the rides section above I have benefited a great deal from being part of a group with my Audax rides even though the association is very loose. Perhaps the goal for this month could be to find a group of some sort; something that would help me to stay focused.</p>
<p>Looking at my hour logs this month I can see that I haven't been doing any programming at all. It takes me back to the time when I first moved here and asked myself why I was studying programming so fervently: was it to further my career and career prospects or simply because I had a passion for it? I've asked myself this question time and time again and came to the conclusion at some point that I should treat it as a passion and not worry too much about the amount of time I spent on it. If the passion was aroused then I should go with it but there wasn't any need to find ways to arouse the passion if it wasn't there. Nevertheless, I do feel a little disappointed with myself. Rather than these peaks and troughs I would prefer something that was much steadier and yet ongoing even if it was only half an hour a day: better that than a massive burst followed by nothing for a long period. I know that in order to excel at programming one needs to spend a lot of time doing it but there is no sense in forcing myself to do it. Even coaxing or persuading when the interest has clearly dwindled away as with my music is rather like a parent pushing their child to be a doctor or lawyer when they clearly want to be an artist.</p>
<p>But it's not quite as black & white as that. I do have a passion for the subject and I do want to nurture that without destroying it by having this dream about remote working. I have a vague and undefined goal of getting regular work as a programmer but doing it remotely and very much on a part-time basis. But I am of the belief that in order to be able to secure such work I need to be at a skill level far greater than my current one. This may or may not be the case but I believe it.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>For next year the plan is to work on my typing 2-3 times a week rather than aiming for a daily routine and then having perhaps an intensive month at some point.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>Due to my poor performance last month and also due to the lack of passion for it I was wondering to drop this goal but while looking for an easy book this month to get me started again I thought I'd try the Scarlet Letter once again, so that's my book for November. Who knows, I may actually get to the end.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 22nd November, I completed the Scarlet Letter. Once I had got a little further into the book, had a feel of the characters and gist of the story, I found it quite compelling, beautifully written and giving a sense of the power of symbols. Time to choose a new book!</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Entertainment</h4>
<p>The couch potato is making a comeback. It's been happening through the year but I am no longer in denial about it. I've been bingeing on TV series and there are days when I watch up to 4 episodes of a series which is around 3 hours in total. I'm allowing myself to do this and feeling less guilty and anxious about it and even seem to be applauding and facilitating it this month by looking into my overall entertainment strategy.</p>
<p>At the start of the year I got myself a Cineworld Unlimited card in order to try and offset the time I spend watching movies and TV series at home by making an event out of it. This did actually work for a very short time but soon I found that the films on offer didn't excite me or they weren't available at a time that suited me. I also found that movies I really did want to watch were not on release for long enough and if I missed the window they were simply gone. As the year has gone on I haven't been going to the cinema more than 3 times a month which is what is required to make the purchase of the Unlimited card worthwhile. It's been great to have it in order to go and have a father and daughter date with Maya but that formula can become a little repetitive after a while and the money I saved on my own ticket got used up in paying for snacks and drinks as well as her ticket. If in that month I hadn't gone to the cinema on my own i.e. at any other time then I was effectively paying more than the normal adult price for a ticket than assuming that I had got free entry. Owing to the above I am wondering if I should continue and renew my Unlimited card in 2016. There are some movies that do benefit from the big screen experience and 3D can be very enjoyable too but neither of these are enough of a draw for me to continue to pay my &pound;18.99 a month. Given my current lifestyle and my taste in movies this arrangement clearly isn't working.</p>
<p>Enter online streaming. Having made use of the various 'free' online streaming services and the less than SD quality that is on offer, I have been exploring my options in the world of paid subscriber streaming services. There are many to choose from but at the top of the list are Netflix and Amazon Instant Video. I've signed up for months free trial with Netflix and have been busy consuming content. The first assumption to be burst was that it was a repository of content but that is not the case: they operate more like a channel. Not everything you could imagine is on offer or even available indefinitely. Rather like BBC iPlayer, programmes are available until a certain date. What I like so far is that there is a good choice and plenty that I like. The picture quality is very good and far better than what I've been used to from the 'free' streaming services. I like the user interface. There is a good selection for kids which means that Maya can be entertained when she is visiting. But I am slightly miffed that it is not a library of films and TV as I had hoped which would be available indefinitely. There were certain series that I was following before I signed up that were not available on Netflix. So it means that what I will be paying for is the user interface and the picture quality. I imagine that in due course the 'free' channels will eventually offer HD and in the meantime, if I do choose to sign up properly to Netflix and find that a series I really want to watch is not available then I can still watch it on the 'free' service. I was hoping also to discard movies that I have archived on DVD etc. but if Netflix has an expiry date on content then perhaps I should hold on to it.</p>
<p>But to return to the idea of entertainment itself: I seem to be less guilty about it as part of my life and allowing it to exist or co-exist. It's not a goal as such but then perhaps it is in an implicit way. I do choose certain movies and TV series to watch and then spend time watching them. I get excited about watching them and I tend to focus and drop everything else while I do it. The guilt isn't totally gone, far from it but at least I seem to be managing it better and not pretending that this something that I want to banish from my life. I'm not proud of the fact that I spend a lot of time watching TV, especially binge watching, but there it is. Better than drink or drugs I guess. As well as the guilt there is a measure of disappointment too but I'm trying to justify and rationalise my saying that perhaps all pursuits are a form of entertainment.</p>
