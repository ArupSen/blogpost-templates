<p>I've noticed that my lodger gets on the rollers when he comes home after a ride. But I see the benefit more as a means of warming up rather than warming down. But as I didn't go on them this morning it would be the ideal oppotunity. I set up in the same spot but this time placed my iPad in my line of sight on the edge of the bath tub and set the timer to count down from 16 minutes. I did wobble a little but on the whole was fairly steady for the 15 min 23 secs duration. At the 10 min mark I tried to increas my leg speed for 30 secs and then did the same again at 5 mins. It's not as easy as it sound because you need to keep it steady and any kind of bouncing in the saddle means that you lose stability. Riding after being on the road did mean that I was nicely warmed up prior to getting on the rollers but it didn't really feel like much of cool down. Still enjoyable and felt good that I just got home and did it.</p>
