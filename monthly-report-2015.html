<p>It's the 5th of September and I feel a bit behind as I'm only starting this months report today and I haven't put out last month's report just yet. But then what does it really matter. I mean it goes on my blog and apart from me there are only a handful of people that read it, if that. But I've been doing it for a long time on a regular basis and it has become a habit and I tend to feel out of sorts if I don't do it. Is it a crutch? Perhaps that's not the best analogy more like healthy food or general training that keeps me on the ball. By writing these reports I look back over the recent past and reflect back to myself how I'm doing.</p>
<p>Here we are on the 22nd of September and the month seems to be flying by but the main thing is that I seem to be getting on with things and not too worried about what I'm doing and not doing. I'm getting into the programming which is really pleasing.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>August has been carried over into September and my current workout of three supersets is working rather well. I often think back to the days when I could barely do one pull-up and in this workout I'm doing 10 sets of 5 or a total of 50! That is way beyond the expectations I would have had at the time and now it's just normal.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Sunday 21st, I was at the park with Maya and it was a very pleasant day and now there are lots of exercise stations at Mayow Park I decided to have a go at them. I mainly focused on pull-ups and dips. The metal bars are tough on the hands so it felt very sore afterwards but as well as doing the main exercises I also had a go at the monkey bars and various climbing apparatus that the kids were using. Pushed myself pretty hard so decided to skip my usual session on the Monday. I'm really keen now to be able to do the muscle up and various other street workout moves.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p>For a week or so I had lots of veggies from the market and used them to prepare meals but once they were gone and the weather got a bit cooler I've gone back to junk food. Now that I'm getting into the strength training a bit more perhaps I will start eating more protein and consider what will help me to get ripped and build muscle. I'm not a big meat eater so I guess it'll be tuna and eggs but that isn't a bad thing as it will stop me eating the fatty and sugary stuff that normally attracts me.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>Still keeping it up and seem to have settled into a format which is doing something quite freeform along with watching something. It's actually better when I don't watch something but haven't managed to wean myself off that. I'm staying with it which I guess is the main thing. Perhaps getting the countdown going again might help to keep me focused.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p>It's on the list but doesn't seem much of a priority at the moment. I have done a lot over the course of the year so it doesn't bother me too much but then again I am bothered so there is that.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>It's the 13th of September and the day after an Audax ride. Probably the hardest ride that I've ridden this year but it had to be done as it was the only calendar ride that would have fitted into my schedule. 300km and extremely hilly with 4.5 AAA or Audax Altitude Award points. I'll write a separate more detailed post about it. I haven't done any other rides this month even for training and now that this one is done and my RRtY quota for this month done I am free to ride or not ride. Hopefully I'll get another long ride in this month though. I had my eye on a calendar ride on the 26th of the month called Cheddar Gorgeous but have a Samaritans shift on that date.</p>
<p>Since that Greenwich Mean Climb ride on the 12th I haven't done much in the way of riding and training. Hopefully this week, weather pending, I will get another ride in.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p>I signed to part 2 of Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python from Rice University as I did Part 1 a couple of years ago but as expected I haven't really found the time to devote myself to it. Hopefully the next offering though. In the meantime I have been tying up many other jobs and projects so that I can focus a bit more on my programming studies. I have been doing Code School courses, Code Eval problems, watching lectures and tutorials on functional aspects of javascript and reading 'You don't know JS'. I'm into it, I'm really into it.</p>
<p>The Python course with Rice University didn't happen. Well, what I mean to say is that it didn't happen for me. But that is not to say that I did no programming. In fact I've been doing a good deal of Code Eval problems and generally reading about Javascript and browsing the function reference on MDN or Mozilla Developer Network. I don't care if it will or will not lead to work: I'm enjoying it and I'm purely following my interest and making time for it. I've realised that I sometimes make it into a sort of ceremony and make it too special and then it gets put off till later and later in the day. So I just make a start and then end up doing a lot more.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>When I stopped doing this a few months ago I had the excuse of freeing time to do roller training but I no longer have that excuse. The reminder still goes off on my phone which of course makes me think about it so I think I'll gradually drift back into it this month. But no pressure as I'm fairly happy with my speed at the moment but the accuracy could do with some work.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>Having missed reading altogether during the last few days of August and pretty much the first few days of September too I have started up again today on the 7th. Still reading the Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne. The style is very different to any that I have read before but has some allure. I should imagine that I will continue with this till the end, either of the book or the month. I've set a Reading Day for this month on the 13th, something that has been missed many times this year. Hopefully, being on a day following a ride might allow me to just chill out and read.</p>
<p>Today is the 13th but Reading Day didn't really happen. I was far more tired than I had expected after the ride and didn't manage to sleep well. I did manage to read for my usual half an hour but that was about all. I am enjoying the book but wanted to have a more general day off and allow myself to be distracted by distraction. Think I'll have to assign another day this month as it would be nice to have a proper reading day.</p>
