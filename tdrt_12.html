<p>After a day of small jobs carried out consecutively one cannot help but feel the urge to put aside any further obligations but I was determined to carry out what I had planned and in short commenced upon a block of exercise which started with a roller session, followed immediately by strength training and yoga. Dressed in only cycling shorts and shoes I donned a tea towel upon my head and fortified myself with the sounds of <a href="http://bassdrive.com" target="_blank" title="bassdrive baby">bassdrive</a> delivered through bluetooth earphones. The moment I mounted the bike I began pedalling at a rate far higher than my regular one. I felt unshakeable and continued at this rate. When the countdown timer showed 10 mins remaining I raced as fast as I could and held it for almost 40 seconds and slowed only a little after that time. I wondered about doing a possible longer session and what my schedule would be after my 30 days were over. At 5 minutes to go I once again raced like a sprinter rising from the blocks. I was in very good form and continued for some minutes after the countdown had ended.</p>
