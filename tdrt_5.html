<p>I got myself ready and when I climbed onto the bike I felt very shaky. My confidence dropped for a moment. Yesterday, after my session I was sprinting a lot on the roads and I think I may have overdone it. I watched a few roller training videos on YouTube but found them all a bit too varied and a little too advanced. In order to do them properly I would require an interval timer (which I think I have on my phone) and a cadence sensor (which I don't have). I focused on pedalling smoothly and increasing my rev count. As the session progressed I did indeed get smoother and steadier. Toward the end I got a bit bored and was wishing for the countdown timer alarm to sound but due to the loudness of the rollers I missed it and it was the sting of sweat going into my eyes that forced me to dismount. Still early days and a reminder that I shouldn't try to get ahead of myself and get too cocky just yet.</p>
