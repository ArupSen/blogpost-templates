<p>It's the 13th of the month as I write this and for various reasons (mainly neglect) I have not set my goals at the start of the month and that means that I feel very behind with it all not knowing exactly what it is that I'm working on. I know that most of my goals are ongoing so I'm sort of safe but it would be nice to have that clearer idea and to be able home in on that. So aside from Audax and Reading which I did set at the start of the month the rest will be set now.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>My goal is to focus more on the rings and to find a routine that is a little bit different to what I have been doing more or less for the whole of the year. I don't want a big change but little variations here and there and doing most if not all of the exercises on the rings will do that.</p>
<p>I managed to take the rings to the park for the very first time during the week starting the 6th of May and also did it 3 times that week as the weather was suitable. Doing it in public makes it a touch more difficult but being outdoors is very exhilarating and I enjoyed it very much. The self-consciousness died away over those 3 days and I think that I will do my workout in the park whenever the weather is nice. I also watched a good amount of YouTube videos to help motivate me and read about the benefits of rings and the best movements and exercises for beginners.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Diet</h4>
<p>The goal is to get my 2 days a week fasting on track again as well as my meal plans such as tuna salad for lunch. My housemate tends to eat egg salads more than anything and I think it would be a great standby if I didn't happen to think of anything when it wasn't a junk food night.</p>
<p>I can't think of a better system than to base all of my meals around protein so I've continuing with that and so far this month slowly but surely I'm getting there.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Yoga practice</h4>
<p>My goal is to continue with what I set at the start of the year which was to work on the free standing handstand and this month also to simply stay in postures a little longer.</p>
<p>Using my bodyweight or some other weight to gradually sink into postures has been very satisfying as well as resuming my handstand focus.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing Clutter</h4>
<p>Really can't think of a goal but as there is a bric-a-brac collection for Samaritans I can put a few things into that. The items I listed on eBay didn't sell so I will need to have a rethink about those items. I have items that are too valuable to throw out but not valuable enough to try to sell.</p>
<p>I did manage to give out a couple of songwriting books on long term loan and hopefully they won't be returning them too soon.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>This month I have only 2 rides planned: a 400km ride on the 4th (my first) and a 300km ride on the 19th (one that I rode last year that I enjoyed so much I would like to ride again). Having achieved so much in May I'm going to step back a little. Both of these rides I plan to ride fixed gear.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming</h4>
<p>I suppose the goal this month would be to continue to work on the TDD and use that as a means of solving Code Eval challenges as this is still inspiring me. I still wonder about my Code School subscription and think that I ought to be using it but then sometimes we do order things or book things and when the time comes don't feel much in the mood for it. Sunk costs etc.</p>
<p>I have written the problem on the whiteboard and have set up a Jasmine environment but that's all so far, not one test.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>The goal is to continue as before: working on accuracy over speed and looking to maintain what I have and gradually increase my speed without any great urgency.</p>
<p>Only missed one session and still really enjoying it. Speed does seem to be inching up.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I'm going to be a little ambitious and set a goal of a Reading Day this month. I've set this goal so many times and have failed to achieve it but I'm going to set it anyway: perhaps this month I will actually have that day. The other goal is to complete The Old Curiosity Shop and start the next book in the series.</p>
<p>Haven't set a Reading Day as yet but have been dipping into the book without having to tell myself that I need to work on it.</p>
<li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
<p>Many things to work on now that I'm a committee member. The first really would be to define my new role as publicity lead. Then to complete the Trustee training because committee members are also trustees. I also want to become a mentor which means reading through the mentor handbook and there is my idea of teaching yoga to fundraise so I need to figure out if that is possible.</p>
<p>I helped out with an information evening and it was interesting to be on the other side and  be seen as the Samaritan. It gave me chance to talk to someone who might be able put me in touch with a venue where I could teach yoga. The following week I also got a chance to speak to someone who deals with the mentoring process and who gave me a good amount of pointers as well as giving me some positive feedback on qualities as a potential mentor. This motivated me even more to become a mentor. I attended my first committee meeting and realised that I'm not really used to meetings and am totally unfamiliar with the procedure.</p>
<li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
<p>The one-off goal this month is gardening. Now that summer has started everything is growing fast but the council have also started their garden waste collection service so there won't be piles of grass cuttings and branch clippings littering the place. My housemate has some garden goals too so we'll work on them together.</p>
