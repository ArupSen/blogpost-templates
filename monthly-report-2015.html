<p>May is about to end in half an hour and I'm looking forward to starting a new month. Lots of things got missed in May so I feel like I want to put it all behind and start fresh.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>Strictly speaking it's not riding but I want to get into using my rollers. I bought them as a means to get on the bike when I wasn't able to get out of the house if it was raining or if Maya was here but it just hasn't been happening and in a way I've forgotten about them. I see my lodger using them on a regular basis and I want to do the same but I still need to go through the initial learning curve. At first I thought about scheduling them in once a week but I don't think I'm going to get used to them that way. I need a more intensive break in period so perhaps if I were to use them every day throughout June. Obviously on some days this won't be possible but certainly I can find 15 minutes or so each of the days when I'm going to be home.</p>
