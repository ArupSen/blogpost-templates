<p>This year, 2015 has been an excellent year and has been as close to a perfect year as I could have imagined. Yes, I could do better, one can always do better and that is what I will aim for in 2016 but compared to previous years it really has been magnificent. I've kept up all of my practices and routines for the better part of the whole year and not only that, I have had a heartfelt connection to them all. The sentitment that captures it best is that I want what I have. I wouldn't have had it any other way. Things just sort of fell into place and I had to do little or nothing to keep it all going. This reassurance that the routines were established and that I could rely on them to stay in place allowed me to build upon what I already had. This really was the biggest difference between this year and previous years: I wasn't in the process of continually rebuilding foundations that kept crumbling repeatedly. The flagship of all of my goals this year was the RRtY challenge in Audax and all other goals and even work was put aside in order that this goal was achieved. It showed me how to remain focused for the entire year and that I was capable of far more than I thought possible.</p>
