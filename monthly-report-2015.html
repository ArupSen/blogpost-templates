<p>We start August, today being the 3rd, with a change of focus. The first half of the year has been very much about cycling and Audax and that will of course continue till the end of the year but now that the Samaritans Initial Training is complete I can now focus on the Programming Training. It feels like I had a month off in July so time to get back to work. Taking it easy was kind of the plan and as well as getting into my studies again I also need to start looking for work to cover the loss of income from giving up my regular Tuesday lunchtime yoga class.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>Having thought last month about pure strength and adding extra weight to my usual bodyweight exercises I seem to have changed tack and am focusing more on volume again after working out with Greg and following the advice given in the YouTube videos he has sent me about Calisthenics workouts. I tried out one of these today and did 50 pull-ups in total but didn't feel as taxed as I thought I would.</p>
<p>After a week of this new regime I did feel very tired which affected everything else that I do. The length of the session has also increased from around 25 minutes to now 45 minutes. Feels good though to be able to perform this many repetitions and thinking back to a time when I couldn't do any pull-ups at all.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p>Following my concerns about overdoing the junk food intake I am looking at ways to generally reduce consumption. Even though I am eating only five days a week due to the other two being fast days I still manage to overeat. Shopping at the market vegetables are really cheap and I don't seem to eat much fruit so I need to gradually introduce or re-introduce vegetables into my diet but without putting pressure on myself to cut down or cut out the bad stuff. Now that I've reached my target weight it's more about keeping it there and consuming foods that contain more nutrition rather than tasty sugar, fat and salt. This should be interesting.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>Still feel that I should have some sort of routine or program. The freeform or organic way is working pretty well but now that I am teaching very little I am unable to rely on it as part of my practice.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p>I didn't do very well with this in July and it was on my mind a lot. More stuff does keep coming in and I live in a flat where it can look as though I don't have a lot but there is still so much that could be discarded. I think I have to bite the bullet and chuck it. As with some of the other things though such as yoga and diet, it's a question of getting into the habit and then keeping that habit up.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>I am slightly going off the boil in terms of riding. I mean not totally but the verve that I had at the start of the year has certainly gone and I don't feel quite as motivated. I still have five 200's to ride and I really just want to tick them off so I don't feel under pressure to complete my twelve. But it has provided good discipline and I think in general it's a good way to keep ones fitness up.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p>I have a plan, which is to work my through the "Functional Javascript" book. Towards the end of July I was watching a few videos about Javascript and also about functional programming, both in Javascript and other languages so it seems that is where my current interest lies. Best to stick with whatever naturally enthuses me rather than studying something which I think would be a good idea or would perhaps be useful in a future career. The other part of the plan is to clock up at least ten hours a week either by hours scattered throughout the week or by having a "Programming Day" every week. I am hoping to do this for the rest of the year but to start with it'll be a 4-6 week course and I should work my way through this book without interruption.</p>
<p>Having decided that I'm going to make a start with the programming and also decided what to study I have an idea for making money. So I'm already distracted and jumping ship. It's an extended spoke calculator where you can save your data and go back to it. Free and paid options with the paid service offering full access. If I can get a load of subscribers then I get a regular monthly income which means that I won't really need to work as such aside from a bit of maintenace and promotion.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>I stopped doing this due to the roller training but didn't complete my 30 days and now I'm using that as an excuse to avoid it. I have renewed my subscription to Type Scout so I have no excuse.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>Starting the month with another Lee Child novel featuring Jack Reacher called "Worth Dying For" which picks up where the last one ended.</p>
