<p>Day one, the first of Jan. A blank file set up and ready for filling with some good reports.</p>
<p>Now at day 12 I've had my first dip following the initial enthusiasm at the start of the year. But then I had been flying high so flying at an average height did feel somewhat low. It was my first full weekend with Maya this year and one of my aims was to prevent her from watching too much, be it Disney movies or YouTube. I did manage to do this but it did involve doing more things together. That was a good thing but it showed me that I have been allowing her to watch a lot of videos while I get on with things that I need to do. It has meant that I haven't really been spending as much quality time with her as I could given that I only see her every other weekend. If she was living with me full time then giving her a chance to watch movies while I get on with something else makes sense but that is not the case. I don't see her day to day and the time that we spend together is very concentrated, which means that the more that we can actively do together the better. This weekend we went to a party, did a few errands and went swimming. The other change is that I have been training myself to get up earlier due to the ride coming up next weekend. Following xmas I was rising at around 0830 and to suddenly rise at 0500 is too much of a shock to the system. Leading up to the weekend I rose at 0700 for two days and then at 0600 over the weekend. Today I rose at just after 0600 unassisted by the alarm clock. When Maya is staying with me what usually happens is that I put her to bed, often a little later than her usual bedtime because it's the weekend and because I tend to go to bed a bit later. But when I read the story (which often I'm reluctant to do) I tend to nod off and then feel groggy when I finally leave the room. I do a few things for a couple of hours and then return to bed at my usual time of 0130 only to be woken by Maya at 0730 feeling that I need more sleep. The solution was to both go to bed at the same time which was about 3 hours earlier for me and around an hour later for Maya. She was a lot keener about going to bed knowing that I was going to bed too. In the longer term i.e. for the rest of the year as I'm planning to do a lot more rides being used to getting up early will work in my favour for both offcial rides and training rides. Obviously in the summer it will be a lot easier but so far the change to my personal time zone doesn't feel like a big shift.</p>
<p>Due to the focus on my riding other things seem to have been neglected. But that's not a bad thing. It shows how passionate I am about riding and training and if I free up time to do it then I am giving fuel to what motivates me the most.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>Missed a session on Wednesday (7th) due to doing a long cycle ride but managed to increase my rep count on all exercises today (9th) so I'm very happy with that.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>I've jotted a few notes about what to work on during the first month. Mainly some backbends which is one of the group of postures that I tend to neglect in my classes and also in my own practice. So far it's been a case of swapping out certain postures for other ones.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p>I sold a pair of gloves that had been in my cupboard for a long while. Posted them today (21st) to the lucky winner of ebay auction.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>The first and probably the only opportunity to ride a 200km audax this month will be the one on the 17th called the Willy Warmer. I'm planning to get myself on that one and have started training. Today, the 2nd, a Friday, I did a non-stop 40 mile / 60 km ride down in Kent. It's one that I've ridden before and comes from the bigfoot.cc website. Country lanes with some rolling hills. What I'll need to do is to ride this route again but at night with my new dynamo lights which are yet to arrive. The sun sets around 4.00pm at the moment and I think that I will probably have this distance left to ride after that. The other thing that I need to do is to work on getting up early as the ride starts at 08:00 and I've been getting up well after that.</p>
<p>More training today on the 7th with a 100km ride into Kent and Surrey. There were some very tough long climbs and some sections with headwinds. My toes were frozen in spite of two pairs of socks and even tin foil. I had overshoes too. The rest of me was fairly warm, especially on those climbs. Didn't take many stops as it was too cold but felt fairly comfortable at the end. Left the house at just before 10.00 and was home a little after 3.00. Could I do two of those back to back? Probably. But I'll need to do some of it in the dark so I still need to do the dynamo training. I've now built up a dynamo wheel and my lights have arrived too so possibly Sunday evening. Exciting.</p>
<p>There was rain on Sunday evening so I didn't ride but on Wednesday 11th I got up early and rode to Much Hadham in Hertfordshire with a couple of friends. It's about 60km from my house and I had my new dynamo wheels and lights fitted. Very cold and my back was hurting but I wanted to create the conditions similar to the forthcoming audax. I spent the day there building wheels and then decided to ride all the way home to get the extra mileage and also test out the lighting. It was cold, dark, windy and I was tired. One of my friends had already gone home but the other one decided to join me. I have to say that the lighting was amazing and lit up the road well enough to see where you were going. It also increased visibility which meant greater respect from the cars. It also avoided the possibility of batteries dying. By the end of the ride I was quite fatigued and had to drop down to a low gear but anyway that was 120km under tough conditions and more training in the bag.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 17th and I rode the Willy Warmer 200km audax, my first one of the year. This is what I have been training for this month. I almost didn't do it however because the forecast was saying snow and sleet and I was having problems with my bike. In the end I decided that I should ride it fixed and moved my lights over onto my commuter bike. I thought that as I had been doing lots of training and had changed my sleeping pattern it would be a shame not to take part. Aside from a very cold and sleety first couple of hours the rest was excellent and fairly comfortable. I took it easy as I was riding fixed and got round in 11h 45mins. I slept for almost 11 hours but don't feel too achy the next day. A good strong start to the season I reckon.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p>Alas, much neglect with this so far even though I do have a rough plan.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>I've missed my typing practice for a few days in a row. It's partly due to being busy but I think that the main reason is that I know the end of the exercises in Type Scout is coming up and I have no plan of what to do after that. If I can delay that then I don't need to come up with a new plan but I will have to face it very soon as there are only half a dozen exercises remaining.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I started reading Moby Dick in December 2014 and am continuing with that through January of 2015. I've also set a date for the reading day - it coincides with a fasting day.</p>
<p>It seems that during the third week of the month I seem to have lost touch with the reading, even the basic half an hour a day. There's only one thing for it which is to persuade myself to make a start because once I've actually started I find that I do get quite absorbed in the story. I had planned a reading day on the 19th of this month but when it came to it due to having been on the ride on the 17th and spent most of the day on the 18th recovering I found myself a little behind with my work so I postponed it to the following week on the 26th.</p>
<p>Reading day did happen on the 26th but it didn't go quite as planned. I managed something like 2 and a half hours of actual reading but the rest of the day was spent on random things mainly researching a phone upgrade. Better than nothing I guess.</p>
