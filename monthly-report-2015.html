<p>It's May, it's the start of May and I didn't see it coming. I've been pretty engrossed with April and forgot that it was only 30 days long rather than 31.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>Having missed Wednesday (today being Friday 1st May) due to working on websites I was looking forward to pushing as hard as I could and also adopting some new ideas into my routine. As it has been going so well this year I've been thinking about taking it a step forwards but also cautious that I don't push too far ahead and lose what I've gained by hitting a wall. I have a <a href="https://github.com/ArupSen/workout" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> for my ongoing workout and today I updated it with a small change. The exercises are much the same as I've been doing for the past few months but I changed the order: I did the hardest ones first and the easiest last. I focused on good form: quality rather than quantity even though the mark of progress is increasing the rep count. In the final set I also do a few negatively emphasised reps to push myself to a deeper level of fatigue in the particular muscle groups involved.</p>

<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>So far this year I've been trying to make progress as well as maintain my level. I certainly have been doing it pretty much every day but there has also been a tinge of disappointment due to the lack of structure and real progress in the same way that I've been enjoying with my cycling or strength training. But the difference is that with those I've been actively working on the progress side of things for the past 2 years or so. The progress orientation is already in place and is an entrenched habit. Not so with yoga and even though I have a rough plan to do more backbends and some other postures that I want to work on this year, when I actually do my practice I find myself doing whatever comes to mind and then feeling that I'm not doing what I ought or that I'm simply wasting my time, especially as I am distracted by watching something while I practice. Listening to something would be better but either way it's a distraction. So it seems that I just want to go through the motions, maintain my level and use it as a time to switch off. What I've decided to do this month then is to practice in a more organic or intuitive way and have no particular goal other than to get on the mat. There is no minimum or maximum duration of the practice time nor are there any particular postures that I need to work on nor is there any stipulation of the level of intensity. I have been questions all of the above and thinking that I need to push harder, longer and work on certain postures. Removing that requirement and lack of clarity allows me to simply feel what should come next, how long to hold it and how hard to push. It will teach me to trust myself and the depth of experience that I have gained from many years of practising yoga and also teaching it professionally. Allowing myself to feel what I should be doing rather than trying to formulate any sort of plan will get me to tap into myself and the teacher that my students respond to.</p>

<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>On the 10th of May I'm planning to ride a 200km audax called the Hop Garden. It starts from a village in Kent called Meopham and as it starts at 08:00 and it being a Sunday there are no trains that are early enough to get me to the start on time. I rode out to Ruislip for the London Oxford London ride so I thought I would do the same for this forthcoming ride. Today (Saturday 2nd) I rode to Meopham as a training ride and of course rode back. It's 34km from my house and it took 1h 45mins to get there. That means I'll need to leave just before 06:00 on the Sunday in order to get there in time for some tea and cake before the start of the actual ride. I plotted the route using <a href="http://cyclestreets.net" target="_blank">cyclestreets.net</a> which took me via small backstreets, B-roads and country lanes. It was a very nice route which took me past great swathes of yellow rape fields with warm hazy sunshine falling upon my face. There was a gentle headwind but nothing too difficult. I rode it more or less without a break. I stopped in Meopham to set the route back and then take a photo of the Meopham sign. The ride back started with a long descent which was fairly gentle but lasted more than 10km. I know I will enjoy this at the end of my 200km ride should I decide not to get the train. This was also the first time that I had used my Garmin since the ride to Much Hadham earlier this week when I experienced freezes and slow screen redraws but having cleared the tracklog and turned off the track recording the device performed as smoothly as it ever did in the past. When I got home I felt very fresh as though I had only ridden around the block rather than 70km. I felt very pleased with myself and my level of fitness. I didn't even stop to take any food during the ride but made up for that later on.</p>

<li><h4>Samaritans</h4></li>
<p>Last month I mentioned that having watched a BBC Panorama programme about suicide I was moved to take action and decided to take a look at a voluntary organisation called the Samaritans. I contacted them and filled out an application form and last night (5th of May) went to an information evening. We were shown a short video and then given a presentation about how it all works followed by questions. It's definitely something that I could do but they do require quite a large time commitment and the training is nine weeks and you are required to complete all of the modules in one sweep. Some of the training days fall on Saturdays which are either ride days or days spent with Maya so I will need to think about whether I am able to commit that amount of time. As well as seeing Maya and going on rides I also have a plan of doing more programming so even though this is a great idea in principle and would certainly be a case of following my heart it would conflict with many of my goals. Perhaps I could do it all and perhaps undertaking this training could help me to manage my time even better than I do now.</p>
