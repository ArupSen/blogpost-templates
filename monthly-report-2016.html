<p>It's the 5th of February and I feel that I'm much further into the month than I really am. Not sure why that is, perhaps because many things have been carried over from the previous month and I'm also excited about doing all the things that I do.</p>
<p>It's the 8th of February and the start of week two. I feel that the month is now starting to 'run away' and I haven't got to grips with it yet perhaps because there are goals which have carried over from last month. That makes me feel disappointed.</p>
<p>But it's a sense of disappointment that I tend to feel on a regular basis and something that I have reported in the past: that I tend to focus more on what I failed to achieve rather than celebrate what I did achieve. I wrote about it in my Morning Pages today that in spite of doing well in my strength training and cycling I don't feel that I am doing so well with my other goals. While I was out running errands I reflected on as well allowed myself to feel the disappointment and gradually began to see its cause. My results are not in line with my expectations but then I don't really have a clear idea of what those expectations are or a realistic idea of what could be achieved in a given time frame. That clearly is the purpose of this report: to feed back to myself on both my successes and my failings and details thereof to give me an accurate and realistic survey of the intent of each goal, the feeling of the attempt to achieve it and the actual outcome. Instead of expectation on previous performance I only write about my hopes and fears but since I have been writing these reports for a good length time and very consistently that should afford me the capacity to be more clear and precise in my estimations.</p>
<p>It's the 15th and that makes this the halfway point in the month and I would say that I feel rather good about everything. I feel engaged with all of my goals in that I am progress and not only that but I've been thinking about them when I'm not actually doing them which shows how well I have been doing with them and that they have been good choices and a good fit.</p>
<p>The 22nd of February and that means that it's the start of the final week. I'm reporting on the third week where I was ill and thus took time to rest and recover at least as best I could. There was a distinct lack of cycling and a good amount of sleeping. The week ended with a long weekend with Maya as it was her half-term holidays which meant that she was off school on the Friday and didn't require me to collect her. This allowed me to remain at home on that day and when she is here I usually tend to put aside my goals both from this list and from any work commitments which of course allowed me to rest more fully. When she spends a full weekend with me we usually go swimming on the Sunday but I was far too week to do so which she took incredibly well. We spent the time indulging in Xbox games, watching movies and YouTube as well as eating a good amount of chocolate: a prelude to Easter perhaps which is going to be early this year. On the Saturday I took a long nap and felt well refreshed even though I was experiencing hot flushes and feeling very dizzy throughout the day. But today I'm feeling a lot better but still not 100%. I do feel very committed to all of my goals and it seems that they are taking more of a central position in my life, more than they have ever done before.</p>
<p>It's now the 28th and normally would be the final day of the month but this year being a leap year tomorrow, the 29th is the final day. Will any women propose to me? Probably not. The final week has been one of slow recovery with rest being the main focus and with no time on the bike. It has allowed me to step back from things a little and look at my life to think about the future a little. I'm enjoying all of my goals even though some of them are not progressing as well as I would have liked I am only slightly disappointed. But I haven't really thought about longer term goals for a while and this week gave me some ideas. They are only ideas and not in any way goals or plans. I have often considered living in warmer climes but as I'm enjoying my life here in London and have my family and friends here I don't want to live abroad full time but perhaps go to the warmer place when it's cold here for example from November till the beginning of March. I've often considered Mallorca as a location because I've heard that the cycling is good there but it wouldn't have to be there. I thought about India as I have family there. It's warm and it has a very low cost of living. It's not something that I would put into practice right now as I don't want to miss seeing Maya for that long but perhaps when she is a little bit older.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>Continue with January workout as it seems to be progressing quite well.</p>
<p>Still very much enjoying this but feel that I need some space around me as many of the exercises are done in the doorway. That doesn't stop them being effective and it hasn't really bothered me in the past but I'm feeling a bit cramped.</p>
<p>During the last session I felt a little under par and rather than miss the session or cut it short what I did was to perform an exercise from the previous level in the progression. I only had to do this for a few of the exercises and found that during the session my strength returned. Today I felt similar when I started out but found that I improved in most of my rep counts and enjoyed myself very much indeed. There was no sense of feeling cramped or any other form of annoyance.</p>
<p>What I've been noticing is that quite often the workout with a feeling of low energy and that I perhaps I should cut it short or skip it because I should perhaps consider how I'm actually feeling rather than following my routine. But one day I was very tired after a late night but it turned out that not only was I full of energy when I started but even made progress. Not only in the sense of increasing my rep count but a feeling of control in the exercises and an improvement of form and strictness of style. This gives me a great deal of confidence and encouragement that what I'm doing is working.</p>
<p>On Friday 19th I wanted to skip the workout due to feeling very low on energy due to being ill but I simply cut a touch shorter and then dropped some of the exercises to the previous progression and I was surprised at how well I actually performed. Today, after a weekend of rest, even though I am not fully recovered from my illness, I am though recovered from the previous workout and was able to make progress in nearly all of the exercises.</p>
<p>In spite of being low on energy and motivation I did my workouts even though I missed the Wednesday this past week. I still improved on form, reps and general control and am experiencing fewer aches and pains. I used to get numb hands on the rings especially in my right little finger but now after a few months it's finally starting to wear off. I also used get a lot of pain in my right shoulder which has more or less gone now.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Diet</h4>
<p>See if the 'Chicken Tuesday' idea can be developed into a batch meal with other components. Freeze a meal and then defrost that meal and eat it at some point preferably when you have those times of grazing and feeling lazy about cooking.</p>
<p>When I feel disappointed with my diet my expectation is that I should be able to change to a healthy diet overnight and expunge all forms of undesirable treats entirely. This of course is totally unrealistic and therefore I often swing to the opposite expectation which is that over the course of many weeks, months or even years I will gradually reach a happy balance between the two and that I should not rush this process. I did achieve the 5:2 way of eating more or less overnight so it's clear that I am able to achieve certain dietary goals quite rapidly so what I need to do here is to aim to make my expectations clearer; lay down exactly what I want to eat and what I want to avoid or at least put into a treat category rather like limiting sugar intake for a child.</p>
<p>I have been pleased with my strength training progress and increased the amount of protein that I eat as a consequence but other than the addition at breakfast on my non-fasting days I haven't taken an accurate or systematic approach. As I've mentioned before, I don't want to follow a full time bodybuilders diet which is far too strict for my lifestyle and if anything I am an endurance athlete which is in the opposite end of the spectrum; a marathon runner compared to the sprinter. In order to get a more accurate idea I read some short articles on calculating how much protein I would need to eat in order to increase size and how one would implement that amount into ones daily intake. My current bodyweight is around 60kg and as a rough guide I would need to consume 120g of protein each day. A medium sized egg contains 6g of protein which would mean 20 eggs per day if I were to obtain all of my protein from that particular source. As I am not designing a diet purely to build mass and I don't' want to be eating 6 meals a day or take protein shakes at appointed times I decided that 60g each day would be a good starting point which for easy calculation is 20g per meal and not an excessive amount. But how would this work in terms of actual food and meals? I add an extra egg to my current two scrambled eggs to make the protein count 18g or near enough to the 20g. For lunch I could have a tuna salad. This would also cover my goal of increasing the amount of vegetable content coming into my system. One can of tuna, the ones I buy are 112g of drained weight which is 27g of protein. That's lunch done and I can vary the vegetable content to keep a sense of variety. Then for dinner I have my chicken. The thing I found with the cottage cheese was that I wouldn't eat the whole thing in one meal and then it would spoil which would deter me from having it and even fresh it wasn't something that I wanted to eat repeatedly. I have however discovered mozzarella cheese which I think I can eat on a regular basis.</p>
<p>I tried this strategy over the weekend and found it to be agreeable but perhaps I'm simply riding on a high. But it seems that by following this protein strategy I have addressed all of my dietary goals in one fell sweep. My plan is to take it for a spin over the next 6 weeks i.e. the rest of February and then March and report back at the end of that period.</p>
<p>At times over the previous week I seemed to forget about my new protein regimen but it soon came back to me. Even over the weekend with Maya which often ends up a chocolate fest I was still able keep it up.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Yoga practice</h4>
<p>Create a routine and set one session per week as a session where a routine is followed rather than free form and with no distractions.</p>
<p>Still seems to be more of an organic stretching session and I'm still happy that I'm doing something but it's more about maintenance rather than progress. But how much progress do I want? What am I prepared to do in order to achieve that progress? Do I really care about progress?</p>
<p>I felt a definite lack of motivation towards doing any form of yoga so I thought about what I would do with a client if they were feeling ill but still well enough to do a yoga session. I did something mellow and gentle but nevertheless did something to maintain the momentum. On my teaching day, Thursday as I was not well enough to ride I seemed to have enough energy to complete two classes back to back.</p>
<p>I did miss a few sessions this week and didn't give myself a hard time about it. The sessions that I did were shorter than usual but I congratulated myself in that I did them.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing Clutter</h4>
<p>Set aside a time to think about clutter clearing rather than defer the reminder. One pomodoro unit perhaps.</p>
<p>I took my time looking through the database that I've created listing all of the items that I have considered should be discarded. I even took a photo of one such item ready to put onto eBay but have yet to create an auction.</p>
<p>I have set aside a few mugs that I was planning to take to the charity shop but will instead take them to the Samaritans centre in Croydon where they are badly needed because the only mugs there are very small and hold what I would call a half cup of tea.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>Set dates to ride two perms: the Ditchling Devil and the Boat Trip. Arrange a day to ride to Much Hadham and ride the potential Artisan Audax.</p>
<p>Rode to Much Hadham and back on Wednesday 3rd of February. It was again with the friend with whom I rode to Meopham at the end of January. It was a dry and cold day with some sunshine but also a bit windy. The headwinds did make the riding hard and it was also tough on the return journey with extra luggage in my pannier: I had essentially commuted to collect spokes for a wheel build. I was very impressed with my friend Junior as it was the furthest that he had ever ridden. Not only did he ride at my pace but he wasn't too tired the following day. Amazing.</p>
<p>So far this month I haven't ridden any Audax rides. The plan, if I do with to complete a double RRtY this year is to ride two 'Perms' this month. I was proposing to ride during the night this weekend but it was far too wet and cold and it seems that the weather will remain so. I obviously don't have to complete this challenge and I haven't fully committed myself to it but I still have two weeks remaining. I seem to feel comfortable with the idea of abandoning it.</p>
<p>With the weather being what it has been compounded with my week of illness, something that I have managed to avoid for many months I think that pushing myself to ride during the final week would not be wise. One idea that I had was to ride at night on the 13th but the weather was really not conducive. Only one week now remains for February and it would mean two full days of riding during that week if I were to continue with my double RRtY plan. I could push myself but then it could be detrimental both in terms of my health and in terms of my motivation: as I have already stated, I want to really enjoy this process and I don't really enjoy being under pressure.</p>
<p>For the final two weeks of the month I didn't ride at all. I'm a little (not a lot, only a little) disappointed that even though I had started my chain of 12 in January that having failed to ride any Randonneur events in February means that I have broken that chain, I can restart whenever I like but only if I really want to and feel the urge to do so. In some ways I'm quite glad that this happened and allowed me to step back and survey my relationship with cycling and riding longer distances. It is still something that I want to do but without the pressure; I may or may not start the chain again in March. But I am looking forward to getting on my bike again.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming</h4>
<p>Finish the Git course on Codecademy and then follow up with the courses on Code School.</p>
<p>Although I haven't been continuing with the Git course either on Codecademy or on Code School I have been studying functional programming again and have been working on the challenges on Code Eval. Even though these aren't the goals for the month they are on the list for the year so I'm quite pleased with that. A concept of functional programming called currying suddenly became clearer when I was watching a YouTube video that showed a demonstration of it. This got me more enthusiastic about it and thinking about all the resources that I have at my disposal and the Programming Languages course where I had skipped certain sections due to finding them far too challenging: essentially incomprehensible.</p>
<p>I have been looking at a Code School course called ES2015 which is all about the latest updates to the Javascript language which all the major browsers will be implementing soon enough. I didn't spend too much time on it though but seem to feel comfortable with that.</p>
<p>I had or less lost touch with the ES2015 course and only did a little Code Eval during the final week of the month. I don't mind that too much but I have noticed that I hardly ever think about programming during my day to day and not something that I want to actively pursue in the same way as cycling or diet or reading or some of my other goals. It's still important to me but seems to have lost some of its former lustre.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>Type Scout exercises on Thursday and Sunday evenings as a minimum requirement with any more as a bonus.</p>
<p>So far so good in that I have been doing the sessions on Thursday and Sunday evenings.</p>
<p>When I had the goal set for doing it every day I seemed to do it at best twice a month but now that I have set it for only two times per week I find it so easy and manageable that I also add an extra one and make sure that it gets done.</p>
<p>Now that I am doing the Type Scout sessions on a regular basis 2-3 times per week I feel that I am only maintaining my accuracy and speed but not improving. It's as though I have hit a plateau at 55wpm and 95% accuracy. It's a little frustrating and has got me wondering on how to make better progress and if I should concentrate more on accuracy or speed. I'm fairly happy with the speed but it's the fact that I have to go back and correct the mistakes that really frustrates me more than any loss of speed. In fact, it's the going back to the mistakes that is the greatest cause for the drop in speed. I think then the plan should be to focus on accuracy and move towards that 100%.</p>
<p>I think that I have figured out what is causing me to make the errors that I make: it's getting certain letter pairs the wrong way round. Now that I have noticed it I keep seeing myself doing it for the bulk of the mistakes that I make. As soon as I make an error I stop and look at the error that I have made and it's very much like the classic 'teh' typo for the word 'the'. It is making me consider going back to the very basics and going through the initial training again and re-learning the letter combinations so that I can see which ones are the difficult ones. It would be great if I can iron them out and even eradicate them altogether. That would a great way to step back and work purely on accuracy over speed.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>Finish Pickwick Papers and make a start on (and hopefully complete) Oliver Twist.</p>
<p>On the 5th of February I'm still continuing with Pickwick Papers and there is a good amount remaining. I'm aware that this means I am making things harder for myself in terms of the next book and the overall goal of completing the entire works. I think that a reading day will be required at some stage. Seems to make sense now.</p>
<p>On the 8th of February I am now at 89% completion of the Pickwick Papers but also feel that I have only 21 days remaining to read Oliver Twist if I am to aim to complete one book per month. I have read the first two chapters from Oliver Twist already but as I know the story and have seen the film adaptation the reading I think would be rather cursory. I do feel somewhat disappointed that I didn't finish the book during January but again this is a conflict of expectation vs reality. The goal was to read 3% per day and then increase that amount to the appropriate figure when I missed a day or read less or more than the required amount. But I also expected to cover that 3% in half an hour and in reality it took me more than hour to read 3% of that book. What I'm not taking into account then is the length of the book i.e. the number of pages. I'm not a quick reader by any means and I also need to be in the correct frame of mind to be able to focus on a novel. Sometimes I find myself falling asleep when I sit down to read or if I am pre-occupied with other things I cannot draw my attention away from those subjects to those of the story. These factors haven't really been addressed or considered.</p>
<p>I have however been keeping track of new words in a Mongo DB database.</p>
<p>Halfway through the month and Pickwick Papers completed I am 23% of the way through Oliver Twist. The chapters seem a bit shorter which perhaps helps as well as being familiar with the story itself. One thing that I have missed for many years since reading on the Kindle is reading in the bath. It's something that I used to do a lot and even though I have considered the purchase of a waterproof case I seem to have put it off. After receiving a faulty one a while ago (there was a hole in it), I received a new one last week which allowed me to indulge in this long neglected pleasure.</p>
<p>With one week of the month remaining I have around 45% of Oliver Twist left to read. I have been enjoying it a great deal and am keen to complete it before the end of the month but as I said with the bike rides, I don't want to put myself under undue pressure.</p>
<p>With 2 days of the month remaining I have 14% of Oliver Twist left to read and it may even be possible to complete it before the end of the month but as I'm so close I don't mind if it spills over into the next month. I've been enjoying it very much as the story has become more and more exciting towards the end. I only know the story from seeing the 1968 movie Oliver! which I've now realised only covers part of the original story.</p>
<li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
<p>My first duty of the month was an early morning one where I started by responding to SMS 'calls' and then had planned to move over to taking phone calls but then ended up continuing with SMS for the rest of the shift. I want to improve my skills on all types of 'calls': phone, SMS and emails and wonder if I should focus on just one during a shift or do some of each.</p>
<p>My second shift this month was a twilight which runs from 10pm to 1am. It was a Saturday evening and my duty partner that evening had a cold and I'm fairly certain that I contracted it from her. There were problems with the Connect system so I focused my attention to SMS messages and took only one call. After this I cycled home in the rain which I think also contributed to getting ill.</p>
<p>The shift after this one was on the following Tuesday from 11-15 during the day. There was a walk-in face to face caller which I've never taken before and assumed that as I'm still within my probationary period I wouldn't be allowed to take them even though I was really keen to do so. My duty partner took the 'call' but later on informed that probationers are indeed allowed to take face to face calls. In order to support my duty partner I didn't take any phone calls during this time and generally made myself available should there be a need to assist them in any way. The 'call' went fairly smoothly and I came away having learned a few details about the protocol of taking a face to face call.</p>
<li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
<p>I believe in my idea of the wheel tracking web service but do other wheel builders? I need to ascertain this before I start work on it. This month do some customer research and see how much it is really wanted.</p>
<p>I've put this off and put this off and have now got to a point where I'm thinking that it's the end of the month so I can carry it over. I suppose I was on sick leave so that's OK. Baby steps as they say.</p>
</li>
