<p>I have now been riding Audax since late 2012 and apart from a few mentions under the heading of riding and training in my monthly reports I haven't said anything about it. I've been gradually increasing my distances since my first 100km ride (which was in fact 120km and also very hilly). Last year(2014) my plan was to make the 200km my base distance and then work up from there. But last year I incurred a wrist injury after a fall and that meant some time off the bike which really broke my confidence and so in spite of getting back into riding later on in the year I wasn't able to follow that plan. This year however I made an early start in January with a plan to ride what is known in the Audax world as RRtY or Randonneur Round the Year. In order to achieve this honour a rider has to complete a minimum of a 200km ride each month for 12 consecutive months. The 300km ride in which I took part (and completed) was on the 11th of April and was my fourth of the year.</p>
<p>Based on the ride prior to this one called the LOL or London Oxford London which was a 200km ride but where I rode to and from the start making it more like 260km I thought that it wouldn't really be much further to make it a 300km ride so I thought that perhaps I was ready.</p>
<p>The first thing to figure out with this ride as with any ride are the logistics. How to get there, how to get back, how much food to take with me and other than actual controls where to stop and take breaks. This one was due to start at one minute past midnight so absolutely no problems with trains early in the morning on a Sunday but the food side of things did worry me. Riding at night meant that shops wouldn't be open and I would have to take food with me, which was essentially why I decided to ride this one fixed. That bike is the one on which I commute so it's also more familiar and also has the rack and pannier. A little heavier than the other bike but give me peace of mind. The route was pretty flat and this year I had already ridden a couple of 200km rides on fixed gear so I wasn't worried.</p>
<p>My rough plan was to have kebab or similar take away on the train as the journey would be an hour. But having arrived at the station earlier than I had expected I decided to take a train that got me to Manningtree from Liverpool Street half an hour earlier. When I arrived I noticed how quiet a place it was with a distinct lack of shops. I rode from the station to the village (and that was all it was) to find all the shops already closed it being after 23:00 so I went to where most of the other early arrivals were waiting which was the Moghul curry house. There were a great many bikes parked outside and I wished then that I had arrived earlier to join them. Perhaps next year if I wanted to ride this one again. But I did the next best thing which was to get a take away. I ordered whatever would be easy and got samosas and onion bhajis along with a 1.5 litre bottle of diet coke. This added to an already full pannier bag made it rather heavy but I would have preferred that to being hungry at the start of a long ride through the night.</p>
<p>I got back to Manningtree station, the starting point of the ride, with my take away and began to stuff myself full of samosas and greedily dip the onion bhajis into mango chutney. Many others arrived while I scoffed away and I saw a great variety of riders. There were tandems, folding bikes, lightweight carbon fibre bikes, tricycles, recumbents and even folding bikes not to mention at least a dozen fixed gear riders such as myself. The organiser was giving out blank brevet cards and as soon as midgnight struck riders began to snake their way onto the route in small batches.</p>
<p>Wiping my mouth and having lightened my load somewhat I joined the train of red lights on quiet empty roads. It was a still clear moonlit night and the riders floated along those country roads like swallows at dusk. The organiser had chosen roads with good surfaces and one could feel confident of them remaining in a good condition and not being surprised by ruts or potholes. This allowed me to relax into my own rhythm and find my own speed. But this speed seemed to be a little faster than the bunch just ahead of me so I gradually passed them one by one and found that a handful had latched onto me and were using me to pull them further forwards. At one stage they thanks me for helping me to "close all the gaps" which I later learned to mean that I had brought them up.</p>
<p>There were only four controls on this ride all evenly spaced apart. I was glad of this and also that there were no information controls. The first one was at 76km and even though I was riding very comfortably and moving at a good pace I made myself stop at two and a half hours. This is my rule of thumb of pacing myself: that I take a stop at two to two and half hours. At the beginning it can feel as though it would be easy to go on for longer but I am worried about having that drop in energy towards the end of a ride so I did follow this rule. I found a side road where I could take 5 minutes break and eat an onion bhaji along with a long draft of diet coke. While I was on my break I looked back onto the main route from the side road and saw the train of riders continue on their way. No matter how far ahead you think you are the others are never far behind. One of the reasons that I wanted to stop other than simply to take a break and eat was to have had a break prior to reaching the control so that I wouldn't need to hang around for too long.</p>
<p>The first control was a garage which was scattered with cyclists when I arrived. I had a big smile on my face but most seemed tired and dejected and tried to avoid my gaze. When you're feeling grisly a happy smiling face at 3.00 am isn't always the most welcome. Nevertheless everyone was still very friendly while they poured coffee into their water bottles. Many seemed to have purchased milk too. Being amply supplied by a full pannier bag I opted to buy the smallest snack that I found appetizing in order to get a receipt which was my proof of passage. I ate some more of my Indian take away and after discarding some rubbish I was on my way again. It's easy to stay too long at controls: eating, checking messages, tweeting, stretching and so forth. My general rule is try and keep it to a maximum of 20 minutes and as I had already had a short break prior to this one I kept to my 20 minute rule.</p>
<p>During the next stage I felt bored. It was a long stretch that took the road alongside RAF Lakenheath. There was hardly any traffic and the roads were good. They were also flat. It was rare that I came across any other riders. Ideal conditions you could say in terms of what I enjoy in my rides but there was a sense of doubt. What was there left to prove? I knew I could do it. Even though I hadn't actually done it then I could feel that I had the capability and that I would complete it comfortably so why bother continuing. Soon I realised that this was part of the audax experience: mind-numbing hours where the enjoyment waned somewhat. I say waned because if it had dwindled to nothing then I would probably be getting off and walking. At one point along this stretch I did notice one rider doing just that. I speculated upon his state of mind.</p>
<p>I cruised my way along till the next control and once again used the strategy of stopping on the side of the road somewhere so that I wouldn't stop at the actual control for too long. This time I stopped in a field just as the sun was coming up just for a very short break and to make my way through some of the food that I was carrying. It was beautifully quiet and from behind the hedge in the field I could see individual riders and groups passing me by. Fortified by this nourishment I had renewed vigour and I remembered why I did this: I love riding my bike and where better to ride it than on quiet country lanes. When I got back on the road I passed through some small village which had yet to wake up. It was a Saturday morning and apart from a few delivery vans there wasn't any reason for people to be awake at that hour. The control this time was a manned one for "early birds" who would arrive before the shop opened. It was a man sitting at the back of his van with a small table full of cakes and large bottles of water so that you could fill up. He was also signing brevet cards. I couldn't believe that I was an "early bird". I noticed some faces that I recognised from a previous audax who were just leaving. I finished my take away and my coke and was soon on my way.</p>
