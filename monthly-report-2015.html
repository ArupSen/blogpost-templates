<p>The start of a brand new month and this month as the physical goals are progressing so well my aim is to allow them to continue rolling along while I focus a little more effort toward programming and reading.</p>

<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>On this the very first day of the month as I did last month I began by riding 100km or 107km to be exact. This wasn't an actual audax ride but a route that I have taken from bigfoot.cc and edited slightly taking in the Kent Downs and the Surrey Hills. So far this year I've been riding mainly my fixed gear bike but today was on my geared bike especially as there were some tough climbs. I would say that there were five in all but they all seemed a bit easier than the last time I rode this route as I've been riding long distances on fixed consistently this year. There were also some strong headwinds but the weather was gorgeous. I left the house at 0700 and was home at 1200 which is pretty fast for a slowcoach like me. I made two short 10 minutes stops and was pushing quite hard most of the way rather than taking it easy. I certainly have became a whole lot stronger and fitter. All these extra rides in addition to the actual audax rides are both to maintain my general level but also to get myself ready for that first 300 in April.</p>
<p>Yesterday the 4th of March I did another very long training ride: to Cambridge and back. A little over 200km which should set me up for the forthcoming London-Oxford-London on the 15th which is my next audax ride. This time I wasn't alone and rode with three others for part of the way and one other for the whole distance. The one other is called Brad and we have met a few times on audax rides last year. We became aware that we are both doing training rides in between actual audax rides and as we live very close to each other we decided to train together. We met at 0700 at Tower Bridge along with another friend called Greg and made our way to Highams Park in NE London. Greg knows the area very well and took us on a route through backstreets to avoid the heavy rush hour traffic. At Highams Park we met another friend Diego then set off for Much Hadham. The weather was very pleasant but a little on the chilly side with a touch of headwind. We stopped at the village shop in Much Hadham for snacks then made a long stop at Artisan Cycles. On Wednesdays I usually do strength training unless it's a full days ride when I tend to skip it. I did a couple of sets of pull ups on the roof rafter braces. Couldn't help myself as I felt surprisingly fresh. After food and coffee Brad and I set off for Cambridge. We rode non-stop for the whole 48km that remained. There was strong headwind for most of the way which made the clear bright sunny day less than pleasant but we soldiered on. Having seen "The Theory of Everything" at the cinema the previous day which is set largely in Cambridge it was quite magical to be there. Having arrived at lunchtime we found most of the eateries near the vicinity of our arrival to be full. There was also nowhere to park our bikes. Cambridge being a cycling city has a large population of bicycles and every parking place within eyeshot was occupied. In spite of the slight chill we opted to sit outside with the bikes right next to us. We ate at the West Cornwall Pasty place and both seemed to enjoy it. The temperature wasn't too cold when the sun was out. After a goodly feed we began our journey back. Thankfully the wind had dropped which made for much more pleasant riding. I suggested we stop more frequently but for shorter intervals but in the end we rode the whole way back to Much Hadham again without a break. More food and snacks followed by the final leg back to Walthamstow. This section was during the evening rush hour and even in the country lanes we were met with heavy traffic. The section along the Epping Road was especially unpleasant with narrow roads and vehicles passing us at great speed. I will change the route to avoid this section in the future although on the outward journey the traffic is not so busy. At the end of Wood Street we took another short break before making our way across the metropolis. I had a route in my Garmin that took us via cycle paths to Tower Bridge where we parted company. I continued on the cycle paths even though the main roads may have been quicker: after riding quiet country lanes the heavy London traffic can come as quite a shock. I got home around 2030 and got myself a kebab, a well deserved kebab.</p>

<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>

<li><h4>Typing</h4>

<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I really must finish Moby Dick during the first few days of March and get started on a new book. This really is taking way too long.</p>
<p>In both January and February this year I did manage to dedicate a day to the reading day but found that I got distracted incessantly. Today (2nd) I thought about what a "day" actually meant. I realised that I haven't defined it clearly. When I think of a reading day I sort of imagine myself reading for the whole day without doing much else. But there are other regular tasks during that day such as perhaps strength training or yoga: the reading day has to work around these regular fixtures. If this is the case then what would I consider to be a successful "day" be it reading or programming? As I've been logging my hours this year it falls upon the number of hours accrued on the day. As a realistic target I'm going to assign six hours i.e. greater than or equal to six hours of actual reading whether at home or preferably at a cafe or library being the mark of a successful "day". With a little planning the day before I think this is well within my means and still leaves ample time to carry out the regular fixtures.</p>
<p>I've finally finished Moby Dick on the 7th of March. Blimey, that took a while did it not?</p>
