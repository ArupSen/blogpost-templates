<p>As 2015 drew to a close I was doing so well with my goals that essentially all that I wanted to do was carry everything over to 2016. Other than some small adjustments the same headings will again be there. For the October 2015 monthly report I started to set goals for the month as well as ongoing reporting. These goals were clear and specific and something that could realistically be achieved in a month. But doing this made me think about it as an idea for the whole year. Prior to this, the ongoing goals have been only about getting a routine established as some of the practices were patchy at best. Now that the routines are indeed well established over a period of at least 18 months (the latter half of 2014 & the whole of 2015) I feel that I can rely on them to continue as they are. Rather than set a goal such as "do yoga", it is more about what to do specifically during that session and how that fits in terms of what I am trying to achieve for the whole year. For example, I could be working towards a free standing handstand as a goal for the whole year but then work on certain exercises during June or July. Undertaking the RRtY challenge in Audax during 2015 has taught me how to stay focused for the whole year. I want to do this for all of my goals rather than just one or two. Doing RRtY also meant that I had sacrifice other things. I didn't really make a start on programming till much later in the year and to this end I was considering that I should perhaps remove one or two items from the list: not that they aren't important to me but that they don't need so much focus and can be followed in a less structured and more organic manner.</p>
<p>A compromise between removing goals entirely is to cut back from a more fervent approach to a milder one. With typing for example, which was put on hold while I did my 30 days of roller training, I could do it say 3 times a week and then have perhaps one or two months of the year when I practise more intensively and focus more fully.</p>
<p>Setting a more precise goal for my ongoing ones makes it seem more like a one-off goal but now that I'm getting older I suppose I'm starting to look at years more as a handful of months rather than a more substantial unit of time as I may have done in my younger days. A lot can be achieved in a year but I don't want to heap too much on my plate as it were as I know what is realistic and I want to leave room for entertainment, work and the opportunity for possible new passions such as Samaritans which came along unexpectedly halfway through 2015.</p>
<p>A one-off goal for 2016 is to find a part-time job to supplement my income. I'm increasing all of my rates but it will only just cover my costs. I thought a lot about finding this part-time job in 2015 but did nothing about it. I also have an idea of creating a web service which in theory could yield a small regular income. It may or may not work but I won't know that till I try.</p>
