<p>It has been some time since I have written a report with pen and paper especially after I started the ongoing reporting and setting goals at the start of the month. But today is the very last day of the month and you can guess there was no setting of goals at the start of the month and no reporting till today. Having been somewhat disconnected from the reporting in July and much the same during August it has been more on my mind that you would imagine.</p>
<p>Work wise it has been a quiet month. Not many wheel orders and one yoga client away for the final week. Close to no work on websites. Which has afforded me time to focus on entertainment: watching TV Series, playing games and chatting online. My daughter Maya has also been away for much of it due to school holidays which has given me even more time to play.</p>
<p>Having this spare time has also allowed me to experience boredom which rarely arises when I am engaged with my usual gamut of activities. Boredom and existential doubts. For a few days I wondered at the purpose of being alive, that all I was doing was merely maintaining my existence for no other purpose than existence itself. I eat well, I do a good amount of exercise and enjoy a calm and peaceful life. All of which keeps me mentally and physically healthy. This promotes well being but why? I keep myself healthy in order to keep myself healthy: it all appeared to be a bit pointless. But after a few days the feeling passed. With the great weather that we had during Audax I was able to entertain these feelings at my leisure while spending time lounging in the garden.</p>
<p>A lot of my entertainment hours have been spent playing Pokemon Go which cannot be played from home and you have to 'go' out into the real world which meant that I did a lot of walking while playing. There is a slight pang of guilt from 'wasting' my time doing something that is just silly entertainment but counter balanced by doing some exercise.</p>
<p>Let's look at each of my goals in turn.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>I missed one session due to riding but that was all and it didn't affect my overall routine too much. I'm still using the recommended routine from Reddit and getting stronger but slowly. I don't feel any more numbness or tingling in the hands; I am much steadier in all the holds and even starting to feel a sense of familiarity with the hand stand. I used to get pains in my elbows and also in my left shoulder but those have largely gone now. I can feel that very soon it will be time to move forward.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Diet</h4>
<p>During August my goal was to be stricter with my eating and also monitor my intake using an app called My Fitness Pal. The aim was to see how it would be if I followed a fairly strict plan for a month where I cut out all junk food and snacks and stayed within a calorie count. This actually worked well until about the end of week three when I gravitated towards junk food again. On the ride day of the 24th it obviously fell apart and from then till the end of the month it was sort of half and half and I had stopped tracking too.</p>
<p>My conclusion was that this would be possible to maintain longer term as long as I had an adequate amount of flexibility and enough variety to sustain my efforts. This doesn't allow for eating out or convenience foods or comfort foods.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Yoga practice</h4>
<p>Yoga continues and in much the same way as it has in a distracted way. I have ideas to do it in a less distracted way or to make progress by having a routine but I am holding back from doing so. I'm still happy with the fact that I'm doing it regularly and don't want to rock the boat as it were and lose what I have. I can remember times when I practiced a great deal and times when I did no practice at all.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing Clutter</h4>
<p>I have seen the reminder each Friday morning and did nothing about it this month. There are items that need to go but I have got into that state of mind where it seems that getting rid of them isn't an easy job and so it is put aside.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>This month I have ridden two long ones and they have gone towards my points count for the season. I want to get the 40@40 badge or medal and I am now at 39 points. That gives me all of September to get one more point. I have a 600 planned and in case I DNS/DNF on that one there is ample opportunity to ride a 200. I'm also on track for a double parallel RRtY but less attached to that.</p>
<p>Other than the two rides, one of which was a calendar event on the 6th and the other a DIY permanent event on the 24th I haven't ridden any short training rides. The DIY ended up being closer to a 400 (377) and also riding through the night in the final leg: good training for the forthcoming 600.</p>
<p>Still enjoying the riding and only feeling a slight pressure from the accrual of points.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming</h4>
  <p>I knew that my Code School subscription would be starting again this month on the 26th so I decided to get myself into the swing of things by starting on a free course and one I could do in parallel with my housemate. He is interested in Apple and so we both worked on "Try Objective-C". It was more like Java and C and a syntax that was wholly new to me. Having focused mainly on Javascript and functional styles this made quite a change. It was fun and enjoyable and even challenging at times but only a little. I now have to think about how to spend the next 6 months well.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>All going well and have only missed a couple of sessions. My speed and accuracy remain the same and even though it is good maintenance I wonder about how to move beyond this speed. I read that others have found they god stuck at this speed (55wpm) for a little while.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I am almost at the end of my fifth book of the year at the end of month eight. Part of me now wants to push on and give myself the goal of two books a month for the rest of the year to catch up. But I am a slow reader and having that goal would mean missing other things and put pressure on me to do something that I am essentially doing for pleasure rather than study. OK, so it is a little high brow and at times I do struggle both with the vernacular and the vocabulary but this book, Barnaby Rudge, really was a bit of a page turner but in spite of that I still find myself head nodding when I sit down to read or getting anxious and distracted; getting ideas and then pursuing them.</p>
<li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
<p>This month I have started working with my mentee and we have had three sessions. In the mentoring program a minimum of six sessions are required but we have arranged to do ten. We have been matched really well and seem to have hit it off. It has focused me a great deal on how I am as a Samaritan and particularly at our branch and causing me to self-appraise. During the days when I had this feeling of pointlessness and lack of purpose I wondered about the difference between suicide and euthanasia and how important it was to prevent suicide. This raises doubts about the work I do with Samaritans and something that I need to explore further in order to continue my work as a listening volunteer.</p>
<li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
