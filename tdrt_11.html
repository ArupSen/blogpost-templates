<p>On my commute home I was thinking about getting on the rollers when I got in but once I was through the door I did consider just putting my feet up. I was already dressed for a session with cycling shorts and shoes so decided to set up. It all felt very smooth and steady and more so than it had ever felt before in spite of a lot of lateral movement. The faster spins at 10 and 5 mins I was able to hold for longer and what seemed to be a faster cadence. In the final 5 minutes I changed hand position every 30 secs and when the countdown alarm finally sounded I continued for another 2 mins.</p>
<p>One of the things I thought about while riding on the road was that the experience of the road and rollers is quite different. For a start there is no turning or getting out of the saddle. Aside from hills riding on the road is much easier. Spinning down a hill is fast but almost effortless but requires a great deal of effort on the rollers. But the steadiness and smoother pedal stroke does indeed carry over to rding on the road.</p>
