<p>Remember, remember the 5th of November. Well, that's today and I feel stoked that I have already ticked off my November Audax ride which I rode on Sunday 1st. I do feel a little behind in some things though and as I haven't yet finished my report for October I feel that I may end up writing things that I wanted to say in that report rather than look ahead to the month ahead. One of the new things that I launched in last months report was that as well as tracking goals I was going to use the report at least at the start of the month to set goals just for that particular month.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>I have been progressing really well and I have been increasing all of my reps with the routine that I started in the summer. I have been setting some goals for next year but I have been getting distracted by size and appearance rather than fitness and strength. The workout started life as a supplement to bike training and has grown into a project in itself and I seem to have embraced the bar calisthenics / street workout philosophy of training. The goals for next year are to be able to perform a 'muscle-up' movement as well as a free standing handstand and a movement called a lever. The thing about increasing reps is that it makes the session a lot longer so what I need to do is to change the exercises to make them harder ones and also ones that will lead towards the goals for next year: no reason why I shouldn't start working on them already; the year marker is an arbitrary one after all.</p>

<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>

</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p></p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>I have already ridden my 200km ride for this month and it has been validated which means that my goal of RRtY is almost complete and there is no pressure on me to ride again this month. But as with the strength training I already have goals for next year which is to ride a 400 and a 600 km distance. I need to maintain my fitness and take it up a notch.</p>
