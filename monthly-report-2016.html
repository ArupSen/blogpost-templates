<p>Having set up the goals for the month this will be first and last report. I haven't been keeping an ongoing log this month due to generally being lazy and tired after doing a lot of riding. I also haven't been writing any reports about any of those rides because on the day after the ride even though I keep the day free I rarely have the energy to sit down and draft a write up even though I often think about it during the ride. It's a shame because I've been riding a lot this month but once I had missed the two in April I felt very much behind and then the drafts that I had started had lost their freshness because the next ride had been ridden. You'll just have to make do with the sentence or two that I've written to sum up each one in the rides section.</p>
<p>I'm quite pleased with the fact that riding has taken centre stage again and don't care too much that other goals have received less attention. They haven't been neglected though in spite of the low level of engagement. Where do I see myself in a year's time? Exactly doing the same as I'm doing now and in the same way: because I'm worth it.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>For this month I will continue with the same routine as last month mainly due to missing sessions. Even though I am almost at a stage where I could move on to the next exercise I don't want to do that till I'm totally comfortable with the current exercises and can perform them with good form. If I am feeling brave then I would like to take the rings to the park at some point and do a slightly different routine but no pressure of course.</p>
<p>I have been missing sessions this month due to riding and recovering which has meant only one or two sessions that week and even then cut down sessions just to maintain the momentum. I'm not displeased with this performance because the strength training was always to support my riding and it has certainly served its purpose in that regard.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Diet</h4>
<p>Having missed a few protein rich meals last month I began to wonder if my protein focus was the best idea but as I haven't come up with a better one I will stick with it. What I do aim to do this month is to go to Lewisham market and stock up on some vegetables: when I have a glut of produce I tend to use it and thus incorporate more veggies into my meals.</p>
<p>I did actually manage to buy veggies from Lewisham market on one occasion and did use them in the manner proposed at the start of the month. Due to a good amount of riding though I ate lots of junk food and fatty, sugary snacks, a lack of liquids and a general abandonment of my protein rich diet plan. On two of the weeks this month I also only fasted on one day only after being very tired following a ride and in need of some comfort food. I'm hoping that it will balance out in terms of health offset by the amount of exercise.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Yoga practice</h4>
<p>I've been meaning to create a routine that I can work on now and again but out of fear that it becomes the norm I have avoided it so far. Also out of laziness I guess. This is something that I'd like to do this month.</p>
<p>Only a few missed sessions and others were short ones following rides.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing Clutter</h4>
<p>My plan this month is to chuck one, put one on eBay and give one away. I've already put two items on eBay and hopefully they will sell. As I've often said in previous posts that I can often think that it's not really worth doing unless it's a big item.</p>
<p>Fairly pleased with my progress having thrown out many small items which I often tend to ignore as I tell myself that they make little difference to the overall picture but it's good to maintain the momentum.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>Aside from a (what I'm now calling) short 100km Audax on the 8th with friends the other rides I have planned are perms. One in the middle of the month and one at the end. I'm still half behind my plan to complete a double parallel RRtY and I want to keep up my fitness for my first 400km ride at the beginning of June. The ride at the end of the month will be a multi-day ride which should give me an idea of what it might be like to ride a 600km distance which I plan to attempt at some stage this year.</p>
<p>This seems to have been my main focus this month and I have achieved more than I had expected. I completed four big rides, one every weekend. Very lucky with the weather. The first was the Hop Garden which was 175km with the riding to and from the start. A very warm sunny day and great to be riding with friends. The second was a night ride which was a 200km perm called the Ditchling Devil. Again the weather was just right and adding the distance to and from the start it was around 250km. The third was one in Brighton which again turned out to be a lovely day and I rode with Luke. After the ride I cycled home to make the 100km ride closer to a 200. The final ride of the month was a 200km perm in the Cotswolds. Riding to and from the start added 330km to the weekend which brought it up to 550km in total over 3 days. This was in preparation for my first 600 where I would have to have keep going after having already ridden a long way. I found that the fitness wasn't really the issue but more the motivational side of things. For the month then I rode 1175km of Audax. I'm very happy with that final total and the fact that I enjoyed it all very much.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming</h4>
<p>Having achieved very little last month and feeling very little enthusiasm to engage in the subject I have set the bar much lower. My goal for this month is to work on a hard challenge on Code Eval which will bring together many of the aspects of programming that I have learned and to write a good amount of code rather than merely tinkering with little examples. To help motivate me I have bought a whiteboard and having a larger space to visualise the problem and to have there displayed on the wall may be just the thing. I'll also continue with the jQuery tutorial series that I started last month.</p>
<p>The whiteboard arrived and I put it on the wall. It got me programming and I did work on a Code Eval challenge but it wasn't a hard one. In fact I started with a medium one but then got into learning about TDD / BDD (Test Driven Development / Behaviour Driven Development) and in order to learn about that I worked on an easy challenge. I did enjoy this and worked through a lot of learning material and thought about it while I was away from home. It's a good sign that I've discovered something that is both interesting and engaging. It makes you think about problems in a different way: you focus on what you want or expect rather than how you might go about it. It also gets you more disciplined and rigorous about the pieces of your solution and that each piece should work independently of other pieces. But you also can rely on the fact that having been tested they will continue to work when new pieces are added or combined. It gives you more confidence in building up your solution gradually and you safely try things out without fear of breaking what you have done so far. I had read about this process in the past but didn't really understand how important it would be as a general way of working.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>For the last 2 months I have been working more on accuracy than speed. To start with this seemed to slow me down but the speed has started to gradually creep up again and therefore I will maintain this strategy for May.</p>
<p>I've been very consistent with this one and have been having extra sessions on top of my required two a week. My speed remains steady at around the 50 wpm mark and even though I am not content with that sometimes, for the most part I'm happy and also that my accuracy has increased a great deal.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I'm a month behind with my one book per month goal but then my main goal is to work through the complete works of Charles Dickens so even though I am a little slower than expected I am still continuing with it. I thought perhaps I might do a very short session of speed reading using the app that I have had for a few years on the iPad as a kind of pre-reading warm up.</p>
<p>I didn't use the speed reading app and even though I had many opportunities didn't pick up my book as much as I had hoped. I am now on book 4 which is The Old Curiosity Shop and by the end of the month I had completed 25% of it. The chapters are much shorter in this book than in the previous one which makes it easier to read in smaller bouts but there were days when I didn't read at all. A little disappointed but only a little given the focus on the cycling and even though I thought that I might read a bit more on my recovery days the amount of concentration required was too great and I opted for screen time instead.</p>
<li><h4>Samaritans</h4>
<p>As well as my required number of shifts as a listening volunteer I have been thinking about what other role I could perform at the branch. I was asked to be involved with Caller Support but it doesn't really interest me that much. I have been considering the idea of running a monthly yoga class and giving the profits to the branch. As I have been cutting back on the amount of yoga that I teach this may backfire so I'm keeping it as pending for now. But in general I do want to promote Samaritans as an organisation and to that end I am planning to be more public about the fact that I am involved. I am going to get a Samaritans cycling jersey which I can wear while riding to create awareness and I can also say something about my involvement on the About page of my wheel building site which needs an update as it hasn't had one since 2009.</p>
<p>During my final ride of the month I did indeed wear my Samaritans cycling jersey and hopefully one or two people did become aware that we exist. The other major event in my Samaritans career is that my six month probationary period ended. I have now become a more experienced volunteer at the branch and following the AGM have also become a committee member and taken on the role of Publicity. I have contacted someone about my idea of running regular yoga classes to raise funds and am also thinking about becoming a mentor.</p>
<li><h4>One-off goals</h4>
<p>At the start of the year my one-off goals were to find a part-time job and to work on that web service and after 4 months of the year having passed and having spent little or no time to move towards it I am wondering if I really want those things at all. I mean surely they would give me more more income but as I seem to be breaking even I don't seem to care about that side of my life. But what about saving for a rainy day? I don't seem to care about that either. I have been thinking about Librivox (reading chapters of audio books as a volunteer) but again don't want to put pressure on myself because essentially I want my life to be a leisurely one. So I really don't have any one-off goals as such this month.</p>
