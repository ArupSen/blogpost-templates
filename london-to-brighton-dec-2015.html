<p>On Monday 28th of December 2015, the Christmas Bank Holiday, a friend and I cycled to Brighton from South London. About a week or so prior to that we had ridden together in the Surrey Hills. He is a fellow Audax rider but due to an injury had to step back from longer distances until he had healed. At the end of that ride I suggested a ride that would be between that distance and 100km and London to Brighton would be ideal. It also reminded me of the ride last year in 2014 on the 21st of December which was the ride that inspired me to ride Audax again and prompted me to take up the RRtY challenge. I was looking forward to it as chance just to have a ride that was good distance but wasn't an actual Audax and where I wasn't worried about validation.</p>
<p>I did some very minimal preparations: a nominal clean of the bike; packing of my tools; pumping the up the tyres and the most important part which was putting the map on to my Garmin Etrex GPS unit. There was no need to rise early as we had planned to meet at Purley Cross at 09:30. It was a sunny winters day but also very mild. I set off around 08:40 and took it slowly as there was little traffic and didn't want to arrive too early. By 09:15 I had already arrived at our meeting point but luckily found that Luke had also arrived a little early. After a short greeting we set off.</p>
<p>From Purley to Farthing Downs took only a few minutes and we were soon off the main roads with lush expanses of common grounds either side of us. This only lasted a short while before we entered onto country lanes surrounded by woodland. Very much like Audax routes. I had suggested that Nutfield should be out first stop as there were shops there but we arrived there only half an hour after setting off. Neither of us needed a stop so after about 5 minutes and a small pack of Haribo sweets  we set off once again. The halfway point was Balcombe so we decided to push on till then.</p>
<p>Balcombe is very small but very quaint. The sun was shining and it was warm enough to sit outside. There was a pub where we had stopped before on another ride (with another group) but today alas it was closed. The tea rooms were also closed. The village shop however was open and having bought some snacks we sat down at one of the pub tables and took a break. We talked about rides that we were considering in 2016. I calculated that we should arrive in Brighton in an hour and a half. Having ridden so many longer routes this year this one felt as though it was just one section of a ride rather than a full ride in itself.</p>
<p>The next part of the ride seemed to pass by quickly and before we knew it we were climbing Clayton Hill, which even though is a tough climb is nowhere near as demanding or as long as Ditchling Beacon Hill. At the top of Clayton Hill we turned left to climb just a little further to get a view from the windmill. In the summer the windmill is running and under it there is a shop selling cakes and biscuits made from flour milled there and they also serve tea and coffee. Sadly during the winter it was closed. We enjoyed the view for a few minutes before continuing on our way.</p>
<p>The descent from the other side of Clayton Hill took us to Pyecombe and a cycle path alongside the A23. It was a bit noisy but totally safe. So far we had found the sections of main road very busy perhaps due to it being a Christmas Bank Holiday but rather than complain about it we decided to push on to the finish. I had suggested that we have fish & chips on the beach and this whetted our appetites. Rather than head straight for the Palace Pier which is more iconic as a Brighton destination my route took us over New England hill via Seven Dials to the West Pier (which of course no longer exists). Instead of actually going to the beach we turned right on Western Road and headed straight for Bankers for fish and chips. It was about 13:45 and Luke needed to get back home by 16:30. We decided to eat our fish and chips on the train during our return journey.</p>
<p>There were no direct trains but we would be able to change at Three Bridges and the wait would only be 5 minutes. The half an hour train ride gave us ample time to finish our meal and feel replenished. The connecting train was very full and most people had luggage as it passed via Gatwick Airport so even though we found our way to the bike carriage we weren't able to put our bikes there and sit down. We both got out at Clapham Junction which is very close for Luke and only half an hours ride for me. Even though it was now dark it was still warm enough to continue without putting on that extra layer I had brought with me. I felt very fresh on the ride home and it felt as though I hadn't ridden at all or that it was just a day of commuting. Quite amazing how a year of riding Audax each month can condition you. I really don't want to lose this and probably the main reason I want to do it all again next year. That's the final big ride for 2015 and it's excellent to end on a high.</p>
