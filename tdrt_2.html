<p>Set my phone countdown timer for 18 minutes so that I could ride for 15 and there was enough time and there was enough time to get myself ready. Today I felt a lot more confident and actually managed to put both hands on the bar but had to keep taking one off to support myself on the wall. Sometimes I was able to do this with my shoulder or elbow. Still felt very scared but could feel the fear subside as the ride progressed. 15 minutes felt like a long time.</p>
