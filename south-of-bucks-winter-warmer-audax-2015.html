<p>After the Chilters Pub Crawl Audax ride on the 1st of November I did very little riding during that month. Some general commuting which amounted to no more than 2 hours a day and there were stretches of 2-3 days when I didn't get on the bike at all, not even for a session on the rollers at home. On the one hand I felt relieved to have a break from riding and on the other hand I was worried about my fitness dropping below randonneur level. I needed to do one more ride in December in order to complete the RRtY challenge so in the week before the ride itself I rode to Much Hadham i.e. Artisan Cycles. It was still only 3 hours but it was a continuous ride. I had also planned to ride back but laziness got the better of me and I had a lift home by car with Diego.</p>
<p>The ride I had planned was called the South of Bucks Winter Warmer taking place in the Chilters / Thames Valley where I have ridden many times in the past. I felt fit and had no ailments. No aches and pains and my bike was on good form too. The only thing troubling me was my mind or rather my attitude towards riding. I was getting a bit jaded with having to ride and somehow resented myself about having committed myself to this RRtY challenge and almost wanted to get back at myself by purposely not riding any Audaxes in December. But that would be such a cruel thing to do because all that I needed to do was to spend a day out on my bike. It wasn't a hilly ride so didn't present a challenge in that sense and I could get a train to the start which would accommodate my current lazy attitude to riding (not to mention other areas of my life) so other than the possibility of heavy rain there really weren't any excuses.</p>
<p>At the start of the year when I did find the 200km rides to be challenging and somewhat daunting I said to myself that I would prepare myself as though I was going to ride and if at the last minute I didn't ride for some (good) reason then that was that but I would be ready and prepared. This strategy has served me well over the course of the year and on this occasion it served me well once more.</p>
<p>The usual preparation but it was all a bit last minute: give the bike a once over; modify the GPS route and add the controls; make sure that the batteries for the GPS are charged and check the train times. My rear tyre had a slight nick; not quite a slash but getting close to it. Since I had had a puncture on the previous ride I thought that I had better swap it. I had a set of brand new Continental GP 4000s tyres sitting on the shelf but they were 25mm wide as opposed to my current 23mm tyres (also GP 4000) so rather than only swap the rear I swapped them both. A little more peace of mind. I cleaned the chain and gave it a bit of a wipe down but nothing more. This was already a great deal more maintenance than I normally would do before a ride. An early dinner of tea and toast and set my alarm for 04:30 and went to bed about 21:00 but watched an episode of Gotham which meant it was closer to 22:00 when my head hit the pillow.</p>
<p>I woke up at 03:20 and heard my lodger going to the loo. I thought I should sleep a bit more but as I had woken naturally I assumed that this would be better than trying to catch another hour: quality over quantity. It also meant that I could take my time. I wrote the morning pages then enjoyed another session of tea and toast. I packed a peanut butter & jam sandwich then set off at 05:20 to aim for the 06:29 from Marylebone. Always a joy to ride along deserted streets which are normally so busy and croweded. I noticed a handful of riders at the station waiting for the same train but there didn't seem to be much conversation going on. I followed suit and waited quietly. On the train I spoke to a guy who had taken a fall en route to the station. A bit bruised and worried if he would be in good enough shape to ride so we considered his options. He was obviously putting on a brave face: it had clearly undermined his confidence. I on the other hand was feeling a bit over confident. I knew I could do it. I knew I was fit enough and as such had nothing to prove either to myself or to the world but could I ride 12 in a row? That's why I was there. I tried to look on the bright side: it wasn't raining; it was also a very mild 12 degrees for December; I was wearing my new Parentini Mossa jersey, which was in fact a bit too warm; I was already on the train and simply had to sit on the bike and turn the pedals for a few hours. I kept telling myself that there were no points for speed in Audax and one only had to be fast enough to be inside of the time limit and I certainly was fast enough for that.</p>
<p>A client of mine had told me earlier in the week that the highest priced properties in the UK were in Beaconsfield but the start / finish control was at the motorway services. Easy access for those coming by car and an array of facilities and amenities. The ride was being organised by Terry & Sue Lister who had manned the control at Wendover Woods which was the halfway point of the Chilterns Pub Crawl ride. I really hadn't expected so many people on the ride but seeing the table full of brevet cards and my number being 63, I estimated at least a hundred. (But having received the stats via email from Terry, out of 84 entrants, 56 started and 52 finished.)</p>
<p>It was good to see lots of faces that I recognised and to feel more of an insider than an outsider. I got a chicken sandwich and a cup of tea from Greggs while we waited for the starting gun so to speak. I briefly spoke to Omar (someone I've ridden with before and whose real name I believe is Omar as I know him only as Omash on the LFGSS forum). He had ridden to the start from London. Had I not felt so lazy I might have done the same because I had done so on the previous ride.</p>
<p>As with all Audax starts it was gentle and unceremonious. The lines on the Garmin screen looked confusing and convoluted but I followed the crowd till we were out of the Services and past main roads onto more of a country lane. The wind was blowing hard into our faces. It was a South Westerly of around 20 mph with gusts of 40 mph. I was planning on a 'no heroics' strategy and ducked behind someone going at a pace that was close to mine. It's known as drafting and if you can ride within 2m behind the rider in front then you can be shielded from the wind and thus reduce the amount of effort that you make. Depending on the wind direction you can be directly behind or slightly to one side. The danger was that because they didn't know that I was doing this they might decide to slow down or stop without alerting me and cause some sort of minor mishap. They could also be rather annoyed if they knew what I was doing and didn't want me doing it. Taking all these factors into consideration I decided to go ahead and draft. Another piece of my lazy riding attitude which made me smile. I only did it on on the flat exposed sections of the route where the wind was at its strongest. Far too risky on a descent and not necessary I noticed the difference immediately and adopted this strategy a few times over the ride. But the headwinds only lasted for about a third of the ride after which we were rewarded by tailwinds.</p>
<p>There were no manned controls on this ride and food stops were receipt controls. It makes the organisation a lot easier and for me it makes it easier to bounce the control as I feel less obliged to stop at the designated cafe and make a contribution. During the ride I didn't eat very much. I had been reading how some people ride long distances consuming only dates and that 3 large Medjool dates an hour were a good rule of thumb. But there was a psychological side to it too: I wanted the freedom to be able to consume whatever it was that I was craving at the time. At the first shop stop at 69km I bought a pain a raisin along with a bottle of water. At the 2nd at 127km (in Pangbourne, where I have now been 3 times this year) I was again at a Co-op supermarket but found them sold out so bought a four-pack of large chocolate chip cookies and ate 2 and half. At the third one at 161km I bought a sausage roll from Waitrose and ate half a cookie. Somewhere along the way I had eaten the peanut butter sandwich I had packed. I really didn't want to bring that back home. In total it seemed that I ate less than I would have eaten during a day at home. But I didn't feel too hungry and didn't feel any lack of energy. The point made by those consuming dates was that at low levels of intensity the body is able to metabolise fat stores and the amount of carbohydrate required for race like efforts unnecessary. I did pack dates but brought them home again. I did try to force myself to drink more water but in total it was about 1.5 litres. If the recommended amount is 0.5 litres every hour then I should have consumed 5 litres. But again, even though I consciously tried to drink more than my usual amount this was as far as I got. I refilled my half litre bidon twice and my 750 ml one which I filled with peach squash hardly got touched and returned home.</p>
<p>During my stops, which were no longer than 15 minutes I remained outdoors. This was largely due to my new Parentini Mossa jersey which is windproof, waterproof and very warm. It was even too hot at times with that and a full sleeve base layer. It felt good to be toasty warm while the wind was blowing the grass flat. It gave me a great deal of confidence and again allowed me to bounce controls as I didn't feel the need to go inside and warm myself.</p>
<p>It was a great route but due to concentrating on position or drafting distance or squinting in the wind I wasn't able to appreciate the scenery but there moments when I did take it in. But there were also moments when I thought, "Oh great, not more of this". But I had expected those and ticked them off as they arose.</p>
<p>Darkness fell around 16:30 and made it a different ride. Still windy but now focused on the road surface and trying to avoid being blinded by oncoming cars. Fucking cars. I hate cars when I'm out on a ride. But there was still a tailwind which allowed a good speed with very little effort. With one more control still remaining at 193km, an INFO control, I began to feel bloated as I approached. I put it down to the sausage roll as everything else I had eaten up to that point had digested well. The feeling got worse till I had to stop for a moment. I noticed that my lower back was hurting too which meant either that I wasn't using my core or pushing too hard. It certainly was tempting to see how fast it was possible to go on a straight stretch with a strong wind behind you and all too easy to forget good posture. I also don't ride flat out very often so that when I do my body probably doesn't know how to cope. This is something that I need to introduce into my training. Going hard and doing intervals. This is unknown territory and it is not wise to experiment with unknowns during a ride.</p>
<p>So we're back to speed again. Whenever the idea or the craving for speed arose I told myself that in Audax there were no points for speed. But whenever I struggled to maintain an appreciable speed or was passed by a faster rider, telling myself that speed didn't matter didn't stop me thinking about it. How come that riders that passed me can ride so much faster? How come I am so slow? But how much faster are those riders? And how slow am I really? And if I do want to ride faster then how fast is that and what am I prepared to do in order to achieve that speed? Am I prepared to do anything? I have already mentioned doing interval training but what I am talking about is not sprinting per se as in track riding or short distance events but long distance. I want to get closer to the maximum speed allowed in Audax and stop being a plodder. But do I really? I don't know. I'm certainly not the slowest in the group but I would say below average speed. Perhaps I should read a little on what other Audax riders say about speed. Perhaps they too are in denial that speed is not a concern when really it is.</p>
<p>One annoyance which as it turned out was not as bothersome as I might have expected was my Garmin switching off. This happened during my DIY perm ride in October but didn't happen during the ride in November. It must have happened half a dozen times and when I switched the unit on again it took a good while to pick up the satellite signal. During the final shop stop at the M40 services at Wheatley I removed the batteries and replaced again making sure that they were well settled and the switching off didn't happen again even after changing the track to find my way to Beaconsfield station and also from Marylebone back home.</p>
<p>There was obvious relief when I got through the doors of the Beaconsfield services. I handed over my brevet card along the with the receipts I had collected thinking that it would be returned in the post at some stage but it was valitaded immediately that the 12 rides required for RRtY were complete. I now had a chain of 12 consecutive randonneur rides with which to claim the hallowed prize. I tried not to celebrate or whoop just yet but I did feel a deep satisfaction that my resolve to complete this challenge had paid off and I could finally relax my focus and let the feeling slowly sink in. Once I had made the claim my name would enter into the Audax hall of fame. For some it is meaningless but for me to have my name next to those who have passed through before is indeed a great honour and one that wasn't easily won. Chapeau Mister!</p>
