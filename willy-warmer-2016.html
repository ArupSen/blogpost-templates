<p>The 16th of the first of 2016 was the day of the 200km Willy Warmer Audax ride organised by Paul Stewart. Before I get into the details of the ride I would like to back pedal one year ago and recollect some of what I felt at that time.</p>
<p>A year ago it was the first 200km ride since July 2014 when I had undertaken to ride the Ditchling Devil as a perm. I had struggled during that ride and had spent the latter part of that year off the bike due to studying and also due to a back injury. As well as being out of condition I had also undertaken to ride RRtY and that was what had prompted me back then to ride the Willy Warmer: I would have to ride a 200km (or longer) ride in January at some point for my chain of 12 so why not get it done at the very start of that sequence. I had also never ridden along unlit country lanes after dark and had built up a dynamo wheel just for this ride. (I found it apt that Brad who was riding with me would be using this wheel on his bike and it being his first 200km ride using dynamo lighting.) I rode it on my fixed gear bike due to some last minute issues with my geared bike. My fixed gear bike also had mudguards. That was 2015.</p>
<p>Now fast forward again to 2016 and to honour the previous year I was again riding fixed. Partly for the mudguards and partly to get more FWC or Fixed Wheel Challenge points. This year, having already completed RRtY and thus ridden a good amount through 2015 I was feeling very confident about my ability to complete the distance with relative ease. There were no issues with my bike or any of my equipment but there were issues with my state of mind.</p>
<p>With the RRtY challenge completed in early December I have been questioning my relationship with riding and Audax. I felt very fit and able and ready for more, at least physically. But mentally I was tired of it. More early mornings, more beautiful landscapes, more escapes from the city and of course the inevitable café stops but so what? There was a lot of pressure too. True, that pressure came largely from myself but had given rise to an achievement of which I could be proud. And the part of me that had invested in that challenge wanted to reinvest and this time double the stakes: in 2016 to ride a double parallel RRtY. In addition to this I also wanted to ride an SR or Super Randonneur and complete the FWC by gaining a total of 25 points.</p>
<p>So here was the dilemma: part of me wanted to continue along the Audax path of riding more and further but part of me wanted to just take a complete break from it. I really didn't want to have to deal with that pressure again (or any kind of pressure). An aphorism or working strategy that I used throughout 2015 was to prepare myself and get everything set up as though I would ride on any planned date. I opted to follow this strategy once more in spite of continuous self talk with the polls swinging from one party to the other.</p>
<p>In terms of the actual preparation it was very minimal. I was going to ride my commuter bike which is always ready so aside from inflating the tyres no other pre-flight check was required. I loaded the .gpx file from the organiser without even checking it: a lazy and risky decision on my part. Only one bottle of water as I have noticed that the second one seems to return home unused and a few snickers bars as that was what I had at home in terms of snacks: extra food seems to return home as well especially as I am now more energy efficient.</p>
<p>I was gripped by the clutches of doubt up until I went to bed and told myself that I could change my mind up to the very last minute.</p>
<p>When the alarm sounded at 04:30 (Audax time as far as 2015 is concerned) I set the clock to snooze rather than turn on the light. I lay there bathed in doubt: hours of slumber had not swayed my inclinations. When the alarm sounded a second time I got up and got myself into the kitchen. I listened to the radio while taking breakfast of tea and toast and heard an interview with the first woman to drive a husky dog team one thousand miles from Alaska across the Arctic in temperatures of -50ºC and also through blizzards. December 2015 had been very mild with average temperatures around 10ºC but January 2016 brought with it the real cold of winter but compared to one thousand miles my 200km was a firework to her space rocket and my -2ºC was positively equatorial compared to her -50ºC. I suddenly got perspective and the resolve I had been lacking. I was focused on getting the 06:29 out of Marylebone.</p>
<p>I rode along cold dark and empty roads which were interspersed with the odd rumble of vehicles and plumes of exhaust fumes condensing in the cold air. Passing via Brixton I caught sight of a group of party goers wrapped very warmly. After I had gone over Vauxhall Bridge I realised that I needed to ride a bit faster and pushed the speed. If I didn't make the 06:29 then I would have to wait 40 minutes (I later found out that Brad had done exactly that due to arriving in time to see the train pulling out). I bought my ticket at 06:20 and nodded to two other riders expecting to see many more.</p>
<p>It was only a half hour train ride and then less than 10 minutes to Chalfont St. Peter from Gerrards Cross. The place seemed quieter than I remembered it last year but it was only 07:20 and it soon filled up. I recognised many more faces than I would have done last year. The brevet cards were all laid out alphabetically and looking at the entry numbers I could see around 150 participants.</p>
<p>Although I had spoken to Brad before the start we had lost each other as the ride started. Even though it was cold the sun was out and it made the chill somewhat more bearable. I went at my own pace rather than trying to keep pace with a group. The first section of the ride would be partly along the A40 but there was no snow on the roads or sleet shower this year.</p>
<p>The first control was in Henley and the information required was the name of the animal on the fence, which was a badger. I thought it would be a good point to take a short break and a snack. I had a few snickers bars in my pannier but found them to be near frozen when I took a bite. Not at all the texture I was expecting. Taking a drink my teeth and gums reacted as though I had taken a spoonful of ice cream. I continued to Pangbourne which was only another half an hour away coming down a long and steep descent just before arriving there. I realised that this would have been the climb out of Pangbourne during the South of Bucks Winter Warmer ride in December.</p>
<p>As I had expected, many riders had already gathered at the cafe. It used to be called Little Henrys and this was the name I had expected to see on the brevet card but I saw another name which got me rather confused. All was well when I recognised the location. The new name was Cafe St. Louis. It was too busy to order food and I find that it is only worthwhile if I am riding with someone to actually sit down and eat. I got my stamp and purchased a couple of pastries from the co-op supermarket across the road. A man in the queue behind me who I would not have imagined to be at all interested in cycling asked me about the ride and said that Wiggle organise many sportifs in the Chilterns. I realised immediately that I had been judgemental and had made an assumption based on appearances.</p>
<p>I ate one pastry and half of another then set off once more. Again continuing at my own pace and steering clear of latching on to any rider or group. The mental battle that I had experienced many times in 2015 began to show itself. All the doubts about riding and the reasons why I should take a break from it. It was very cold and of course that didn't help matters much. But as I approached Lambourn I knew that I was almost halfway into the ride. One question which I asked myself was how I would feel if I had to endure this same mental conflict and suffer the same self talk and doubt during each ride. I had loosely planned to complete a double RRtY in 2016 but how could it be worthwhile if the whole process became simply a box ticking exercise?</p>
<p>This touched upon a broader and more general point about the journey and the destination, often referred to as the process vs goal debate but in this particular case was it about the ride itself or getting them done? Why did I start riding Audax in the first place and what do I tell others about my love of Audax style long distance cycling? I say it is a place that sits nicely between racing and touring neither of which interest me to any great extent. I do like the idea of training for races but I find that I lack any of the competitive spirit required to participate. Whereas touring involves far too much luggage and time away from home. But I want to ride long distances and I like a challenge. There is a time limit but it is extremely relaxed and on the other hand there is also a speed limit to discourage racing. Enjoy the ride with no pressure, see some breathtaking countryside along with stops at picturesque villages for some tea and cake. It's all about the joy of riding; getting away from the city and experiencing the countryside and moving at a pace that feels right for you. Now does that include anything about completing 24 rides in the space of a year? Indeed not. It is an extra challenge designed to keep you riding all year round and essentially to get you to ride a bit more than you otherwise would. There is no obligation to undertake any such challenge or even to ride at all but once the challenge has been accepted it's easy to feel under pressure to complete it and as it spans a whole 12 months it is inevitable that doubts would arise. (Perhaps in some cases such doubts would not arise and my own case is in the minority.) But as I continued to Lambourn I reflected on this and decided that if I am to undertake the RRtY challenge again then it has to be focused on the ride itself rather than the accrual of a sequence of 12. Long distance rides by their nature require a good amount of time to complete and this time is taken away from other activities and pursuits: if I am to spend at least 24 days of the year out in the countryside riding my bike then it should in no way be a chore and in fact be something that I yearn for when I am doing chores.</p>
<p>At Lambourn I wrote down the answer to the info question which was the name of a corner shop. I asked one rider if he was warming up: he replied that his willy was not warm, his jocularity failing to mask his grievance. A crowd had gathered outside the co-op munching snacks; I opted to eat my remaining half pastry preferring to wait until Hungerford to take a longer break and consume larger quantities: it was only 13km away and was the actual half-way point of the ride. Hazy intermittent sunshine shone through the hedgerows as riders rode the climb out of Lambourn. My hands were still somewhat warm but my toes were living in a very different climate.</p>
<p>I could see the cluster of bikes parked to the right of the bridge that leads into Hungerford. The Tutti Pole cafe was the halfway control. It was very busy as expected but I wasn't planning to eat there anyway. Having got my brevet card stamped I made my way to yet another co-op supermarket just a little further along the street. There were small groups of riders gathered around various supermarkets and cafes along the street. I spoke to a Japanese rider who was also parked outside the co-op eating his meal. There was a sunny spot where our bikes were parked which made the cold just bearable. He told me that he was studying for a year in the UK and wanted to make the most of Audax. In Japan he rode Audax quite regularly. Having finished my meal and feeling content with my overall progress I was just about to set off when I heard Brad calling out to me. He had just arrived and asked if I would wait so that we could ride together. I was both happy and disappointed.</p>
<p>I was happy to see him because we had planned to ride together and we had met at the start but also disappointed about being a little delayed as I was on the point of setting off. I had got myself into a solo rhythm and it was being disturbed. There are no points for speed in Audax but it was very cold day and in 2 hours or so the sun would be going down. I wasn't travelling particularly fast but at my current pace would probably arrive in 10 and a half hours. It wasn't that I wanted to make a good time but I just wanted to get out of the cold. He didn't seem too concerned. He had joined a fast group at the start of the ride but had worn himself out and taken a very long break at Pangbourne. Partly because he needed it and partly because the service had been very slow. I myself was also very slow from changing from a solo mindset to a group ride mindset: perhaps the cold had frozen my brain.</p>
<p>Earlier I had reflected on the value of focusing on the ride itself rather than the completion, now I was reflecting on the differences between rding solo and riding in a group; a group of two in this case. There are things I like about both and there shades of grey in between such as on calendar rides where you can latch on to a group for only part of the ride. Today it was exactly half solo and half group riding which gave me a perfect opportunity to compare and contrast. Also having built up a body of both solo and group rides over the previous years it was possible to look back and analyse my likes and dislikes. It was also beneficial to do this during the ride as it afforded better recall to previous experiences than sitting at home trying to imagine.</p>
<p>Speed and pace play an important part in a group ride. Your pace needs to be closely matched to your ride partner: if they are slightly faster or slightly slower it can be hard work adjusting. As I had been riding at my own pace so far I found it hard to adjust especially riding fixed gear. Conversation slowed the pace even further which at first I found rather frustrating but after a short while I had changed by frame of mind and was more comfortable with us riding together. After sunset which happened just as we arrived at the next control I could feel my fingers starting to get cold to the point of losing sensation rather akin to plunging ones hand into ice water. I could hardly hold the pen to write down the answer to the info question.</p>
<p>I was starting to feel that the rate of movement wasn't enough for me to generate enough to keep me warm and in sheer frustration I took off at a faster pace. The next control was in Winnersh at a cafe next to a garage. It was due to close at 6.00 and it was now 4.30. Even at an easy pace we could make it in time but I figured that half an hour or so of hard riding would give us the required warmth that we needed followed immediately by a hot drink and a snack. I was hoping that Brad would understand my reason for breaking away. When we arrived he didn't seem to complain and later on recounting the episode to another group he seemed to be proud. Certain thoughts and feelings remain unsaid during group rides perhaps due to ride etiquette or perhaps because they seem important at the time and later on seem less so. Was it just shyness or a case of not wanting to rock the boat just for the sake of it? Or was there an unwritten convention? To be fair to Brad there have been times when I have struggled to keep pace with him and in no way want to paint a picture of him being a plodder but in this case his pace was slower than one at which I wanted to ride. I wasn't comfortable with the situation but couldn't think of a sensitive way to communicate it and imagined the worst.</p>
<p>At the Java Cafe I was shivering in spite of the sprinting. We sat for a good half an hour and in that time I didn't warm up at all. I cupped my hands around my cappuccino and tried to wiggle my toes. The sausage sandwich was very welcome too. Two riders from Audax Club Hackney arrived two minutes later and joined us at the next table. I noticed that they were both wearing winter boots. Perhaps next winter I will do the same. On our table there were a couple of riders from Germany. They too were finding it cold but showed us photos of Cologne from the previous day covered in a thick layer of snow. All three of my companions commented on a connection they had with Cologne. I was about to mention that my ex-wife was from Cologne but thought it might come across as oneupmanship trumping their comments and thus decided to remain silent instead.</p>
<p>The Germans left a few minutes later and gave us our cue to get ourselves ready. The Hackney riders set off at the same time but were soon ahead of us. The terrain was rolling but as it was now getting towards the end of the ride some of the climbs seemed to be more challenging than they were. Frome the previous year I remembered the route to be relatively flat but this time I was pushing 71 instead of 67 gear inches. There was one fairly challenging climb but nothing that made me feel that I needed to get off and walk. There were no more controls and about 40km left to ride which equated to around 2 hours. On the way we passed through Maidenhead, the start of many rides we had ridden together. We pushed on through the still darkness with only the light of our headlamps to guide us.</p>
<p>We arrived a touch before 8.00pm which is 12 hours in total. We saw the Hackney riders who informed us of the time of the next train back to Marylebone. We got our brevet cards stamped and they were immediately validated and returned. I also got a stamp in my special FWC brevet card adding 2 more points to my total. The next day I counted up the points to find that I have at last accumulated the required 25 to complete the challenge. The hall looked fairly deserted and there were not too many bikes parked outside meaning that most had already gone. The food looked tempting but we opted for a quick exit and about 10 minutes later were at Gerrards Cross station.</p>
<p>Brad knew the Hackney riders having been to their social evenings but they were very amenable and welcoming. The Japanese rider that I had met earlier was also in the waiting room. At 20:44 the train arrived and once on board with our bikes settled the Hackney riders opened bottles of Peroni beer which they offered to us. I took only a sip and they mentioned how good it tasted straight after a ride. The conversation turned naturally toward forthcoming rides.</p>
