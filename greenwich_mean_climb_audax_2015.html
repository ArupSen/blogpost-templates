<p>When I was looking for a calendar ride to do in September, the only that seemed to fit my schedule was the Greenwich Mean Climb run by Audax Club Hackney on 12th Sept. It ticked a couple of boxes in that it was 200km or more which is something that I needed in order to continue with the RRtY challenge and it started from next to the Cutty Sark  in Greenwich which is only 20 mins ride from my house. But the negative side or the challenging side (the clue is in the name) is that it had AAA points or Audax Altitude Award points. I tend to avoid any rides with AAA points as I do find hills very demanding both in terms of climbing them and also in terms of descending them. This really would be taking my riding to the next level.</p>
<p>Having ridden a hilly one with Luke a few weeks earlier and having also climbed some tough hills in that area during the Around Weald Odyssey ride a month or so ago I felt reasonably comfortable with my climbing ability and having ridden 3 x 300km rides this year I also felt comfortable with the distance. But with 4.5 AAA points, which means 4,500 metres of climbing, I sensed that it would be bigger challenge than I had envisaged.</p>
<p>Preparation was a snap: reorganise childcare so that Maya could be collected on Friday evening; charge batteries for the Garmin; edit the GPS file and add the controls; go to bed early.</p>
<p>I went to bed at 21:30 ish on Friday and wondered if I would be able to sleep but got straight down and even though I had set 2 alarms for 04:15 I woke naturally at 03:45. I was planning to leave the house at 05:15 which meant that I had 90 minutes to get myself ready. My usual 3 rounds of toast after a day of fasting on Friday. I had bought a few flapjacks for the ride which I packed and printed a copy of the route sheet. Having more time in hand than usual I even did some work: fixing a client's PayPal button on their website.</p>
<p>An easy spin to Greenwich on roads that normally have a lot more traffic meant that I was at the Cutty Sark sooner than expected. A small crowd had assembled in the underground car park nearby where some refreshments were being served. The usual tea, coffee, cakes and biscuits. I met someone that I had ridden with before and very soon the organiser Ivan was in our midst to send us on our way.</p>
<p>The climbing began almost immediately with Maze Hill then Shooters Hill. Then via Dartford to Ebbsfleet station which was the first info control. In order to avoid the very busy road the route moved off to a cycle lane and for some reason I thought the control would be there. I slowed down a great deal and looked anxiously at my Garmin for the flag. Other riders passed me and I wondered if they too had passed it. But a few minutes later on the bridge next to Ebbsfleet station there was there was the flag clearly displayed on the Garmin screen.</p>
<p>Showery rain now began to descend and just as I was thinking about removing my soft shell jacket. It never got too severe but came and went. But now it started to feel more like an Audax as we were off the main roads on country lanes. The terrain grew more lumpy (as the Audax crowd like to call it) and soon, after a steep long descent down Toys Hill there was a manned control in Edenbridge. It was a car park just off the High Street and the location of the start of my first ever Audax ride. There were camping tables set up with all manner of refreshments. I opted for tea and cake and a peanut butter & jam sandwich. There was someone dressed in a shark costume and a generally friendly and jovial gathering. I took a banana and set off again.</p>
<p>There were short sections next with 2 info controls on the way to Seaford. The first was Forest Row which is a very pretty village and again one that I rememebered from other rides in that part of the country. The rain had stopped now and the skies were clearing and it was time to put away my jacket. Only a 5 minute stop as it had been only 40 minutes since Edenbridge so I pushed on Laughton. This took me via Uckfield which was very busy and once again I got anxious about a possible control. But at the same time just wanted to get past all the bumper to bumper traffic. Uckfield is on a hill and having rolled down past the traffic it was time to climb again. I kept looking out for Laughton but realised that I had miscalculated the distance and sure enough the flag came up on the screen a little later. I wrote down the answer to the info question (the distance to Ripe) but this time decided that I needed a short pit stop. I ate the banana and took 5 minutes off the bike.</p>
<p>The route crossed here as it went down to the coast and back. I had added waypoint flags to indicate at which distance I should turn which way. It was difficult to see though with the bike in motion so I stopped. When I was sure of the direction I proceeded. The "Distance to Destination" continued counting down so I knew that I was moving in the right way. The route went via Alfriston and on to Seaford. There were some very tough climbs in this section and it required all my effort and concentration to reach the summit. I was rewarded with a spectacular view and I could see the sea. Reaching the coast always gives a sense of satisfaction and achivement. Just before these climbs I wondered that as the route doubles back on itself whether I would see any of the leading group coming the opposite way on my approach to the beach. Indeed I did. It was just a little after Alfriston and the entrance to Drusillas Park. I tried to calculate how far they might be ahead of me and I estimated that it was at least an hour. One thing I didn't factor in at the time was that our speeds were not constant and that I would probably be slowing down and they would probably be speeding up.</p>
<p>Seaford was windy and had bright sunshine that made you squint. Riders were seated on wooden picnic benches laid on the pebbles and tucking into food and drinks supplied by a tiny kisok cafe. Tim Sollesse, who organised the London-Oxford-London ride was there to stamp the brevet card. We chatted briefly about his forthcoming rides and how he found that once he had conquered the 200km distance the other distances were well within his reach. With a sausage roll, a danish and sugary tea in my belly I began the journey back to Alfriston. I made up a short refrain which only comprised of the words, "sugary, sugary", but pronounced them "soo gary, soo gary". I rarely drink tea with any sugar apart from when I'm riding Audax. The "soo gary" lyric encapsulated that I was on an Audax and that I had drank the classic Audax drink along with a cake of some description. It also indicated that I was in a good mood or rather a sugary one. There were no other lyrics to the song. I sang it in a kind of mock Bollywood style which captured the mood really well and gave the ride, at least at that point, an interesting incidental music. I had had enough food to fill me up but not so much to be feeling nauseated up the next set of hills.</p>
<p>After some food and rest the climbs didn't feel quite as tough and this time I saw those that were behind me. Seeing the leading group out in front made me feel slow but seeing that there were others behind me gave me a little more condfidence in my ablilities. Not that speed is important in Audax but it did give me a bit of a lift. The next control would be Wadhurst and was 45km away. This section was particularly hilly and required a good deal of concentration: focus required on the climbs to maintain rhythm and good breathing; on descents to watch out for gravel and potholes. At one point I noticed a group of 5 riders ahead and wondered about trying to catch them. I asked myself if it would be foolish and an overexpenditure of effort which would lead to pain and lack of energy later. I opted for a compromise which was to see how much faster I could go but at the same time keep my energy expenditure to a minimum. Lower the gear and spin a little bit faster; save the energy for the climbs. I do enjoy climbing hills and remaining in the big outer chainring but doing that would mean wearing myself out too early. I knew there were more climbs to come so forced myself to use the inner ring and take it easy. I actually caught and passed the group and greeted them politely while feeling just a tad smug on the inside. But having done that I guess I would need to maintain that lead and make it bigger: a little smack of pride and a tingle of pressure. I didn't look back but kept on spinning. Now my lower back was starting to hurt.</p>
<p>On my previous 2-3 long rides I had commented to friends that it was the first time that I had experienced no lower back pain or ache I should say, resulting from effort. But on those rides I hadn't experienced such a volume of climbing. And descending. Both of these were causing me to use my lower back more than I would on flatter or more undulating courses. I know that I tend to tense my lower back on descents but I had been addressing that all through the ride but what was causing the pain during the climbs? It struck me that even though I have a strong core I wasn't using it to support my back during the climb, both in and out of the saddle. I tried out my theory and the effect was almost immediate: my back felt better and better the more I engaged my core during the climbing efforts. When I arrived at Wadhurst my back was in far better shape than when I was leaving Seaford. I had also gained about a 5 minute lead on the group that I had passed but then who's counting.</p>
<p>The Wadhurst control was a shop where you had to get a receipt. I only got a packet of crisps but I also ate half a flapjack that I had been carrying in my jersey pocket all day. I didn't stay too long as I needed a toilet stop, so made off towards Bexhill. That would be a manned control and cafe stop and decided to have a proper stop there. There were more ups and downs on the way to Bexhill and I used my new found core engagement techniques to motivate me and keep me focused. The final descent into Bexhill was a gorgeous view lit by late afternoon sunshine. It was the 200km mark and time for a proper sit down. I stopped for almost half an hour and enjoyed a BLT bagel, a pot of tea and a slice of salted caramel shortbread. I chatted to a very experienced rider who was sitting at the same table. He had fish and chips and washed it down with a beer, saying that he couldn't wait till the finish for his drop of grog. He said that he had ridden 7 x 600km rides this year along with PBP (Paris-Brest-Paris), another 1,700km ride somewhere in Europe as well as many others. I couldn't see why I shouldn't believe him. He recommended that I should ride the BCM or Brian Chapman Memorial ride as my first 600km ride which spans the full length of Wales.</p>
