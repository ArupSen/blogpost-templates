<p>Having ridden the Dunwich Dynamo early in July and then a training ride on the 12th I still needed to ride an official Audax ride of 200km or more in order to continue with my RRtY challenge or Randonneur Round the Year. I had a ride called the Devil's Punchbowl booked weeks ago for July 19th but when it came to Saturday 18th I decided to pull out. I didn't want the overnight stay prior to the ride, I hadn't plotted the route sheet to create a .gpx file and there was heavy rain forecast. At first I felt that this was going against my plans that I had made earlier this year and was worried that if I broke the chain I would have to start again with the consecutive sequence of 12. But I didn't seem to care. This worried me even more. I had expended a great deal of effort to accrue six in a row and I was halfway to completing the RRtY challenge and then to turn around and shrug it off as though it wasn't important in place of being a couch potato was quite a rude awakening. Maya was away and it was a rare opportunity to have a full weekend to myself. But being willing to sacrifice something that had been more important to me than anything else all year smacked of betrayal and sheer disbelief. I also recognised that even though being a couch potato doesn't fulfil any of my current goals it is important to me on some level and I guess I needed a break.</p>
<p>Having acknowledged all of these feelings I enjoyed my day off as well as I could but made a promise that I would make it up by riding a perm. (A "perm" or Permanent Event is a non-calendar ride which can be ridden at any time. But in order to get it officially validated one has to enter the event as for a calendar event and then submit either a GPS track log or receipts from the control points as proof of passage.) My desire to complete the RRtY challenge may be low at the moment but it would be a real shame to discard a chain of six. On Sunday evening I put the required .gpx routes on to my Garmin and made sure that track logging was turned on. I charged the batteries but other than that I simply needed to rise early and go.</p>
<p>The ride started from Hillingdon in NW London. I knew the way as far as Kew Bridge and used the Garmin from then on but travelled along roads that I used when I lived in Ealing. I lived in that area only five years ago but it seemed more in the distant past.</p>
<p>There was some drizzle on the way which I hadn't expected and the traffic wasn't too busy. I sat down for a few minutes looking through the notes that accompany the route sheet. I thought that stopping at the designated controls might give the feel of a calendar ride. I ate one snickers bar and headed off. To start with there were some busy main roads which I found a bit scary (got my one and only horn of the day) but it wasn't long before I was rolling along country lanes. More rain showers and this time a bit heavier than drizzle. I could feel the rainwater mixing with sweat and trickling into my eyes. I kept rubbing and drying it out with the soft fabric on the back of my mitt designed of that purpose but it didn't work too long. But the showers gladly didn't last long and there was ample tree cover. It was a warm day and the water was in fact quite pleasant. The emotional weather wasn't good either. I was plagued with many doubts and kept asking myself why I was doing more of these rides when I done so many. More country lanes, more long distances, more pacing myself and more being tired the next day. Hadn't I done enough? Why did I need to prove myself any further? I had achieved my goals: I had become comfortable at the 200, I had ridden a couple of 300's and had even ridden my first 400, so why was I still here? Part of me was just bored with it all and today's ride was just ticking a box which in a sense it was. But mostly I do it because I love it and I knew the bored feeling would pass. It did indeed pass but took a couple of hours and was still there in the background like a scab that has healed but still itches.</p>
<p>The route comprised mainly of good roads with excellent views and also fairly flat. There were a couple of climbs at the end but I remained on the larger outer chainring for the whole of the ride. As well as showery rain I often rode straight into swarms of bugs. They were very tiny and it was like getting sand blown in my face. Some went into my eyes and caused me to rub with the back of my hand once more. Rather unpleasant but gave a sense of countryside and summer. The roads were also very quiet even for a Monday. I sometimes wondered if I was in the same country and where everyone had gone. I noticed that part of the route was exactly the same as the London-Oxford-London ride.</p>
<p>The first place I stopped was Great Kingshill (OK, I had also stopped to take a leak in the woods somewhere, but I'm not counting that one). I bought four snack pork pies and a bottle of water. The staff in there were very friendly. I was surprised as I was expecting them to be surly. The van drivers who were parking outside did however give me the look of surprise I was expecting: you don't often see a middle-aged Asian chap dressed in lycra in English country villages on a weekday. I got a text message from a yoga client about our next session and that evening was a possibility. I replied and told them that I was on a ride and if I finished in time I might even make it. They live about halfway between Hillingdon and my house. Practically on the way if I took a slight detour. This changed the feel of the ride: now I was watching the clock. I had the option of doing yoga with them another night but this evening would be neat and tidy in terms of other plans I had during the week. I could also rest fully the following day.</p>
<p>I started working out times and distances in my head and wondered about the overall time. According to my previous performances my average times were around 12 hours. I would certainly need to be inside that but not my much. My times for 300km rides that I have ridden this year were just over 15 hours so I was looking at 10 hours. I had started at 08:30 and that meant 18:30. If I kept to a steady speed and didn't stop for too long during breaks and barring any mishaps I could do it. But it did mean pushing harder than I usually did but for the entire ride.</p>
<p>By the time I got to the next control which was Waddeston I was inside my predicted time. This was the part that was the same as the Oxford-London-Oxford ride. I was enjoying going faster than my usual speed but also a little concerned about being able to maintain it or worse having a sudden energy crash at some point and losing all my strength. And my worries did indeed come to fruition. Up to the halfway point I noticed pains in my left knee and in order to compensate I decided to push harder with my right leg in order to remove the load. This worked for a while but then I started to get cramps in my right quad a little above my knee. Painful, but not enough to stop me from riding. It didn't slow me down but showed me what would happen if I pushed it too hard. I hardly ever get cramp, perhaps once a year, so this was indeed a sign of over exertion.</p>
<p>The halfway control was in a place called Stoke Bruerne at the Boat Inn which overlooks a lock. A thatch roofed building with gold lettering for the sign. Beautiful and touristic and yet seemingly remote too. There were other locks and canal sections along the way, hence the name of the ride. I took my lunch at the museum cafe across the water from the Boat Inn and soaked up the rural village atmosphere which were once the highways of the country. I looked up the Boat Inn a few days later and it dates back to 1807. I was surprised at the number of tourists for a Monday. I adhered to my 20 minute rule, which actually felt quite long before setting off again.</p>
<p>The next stage was long; a full 50km. I decided to break it up with a short stop. I was low on food supplies and thought it best to stock up at the next control. The route sheet gave 2 options, well actually three: tea rooms, a pub and a supermarket in Tring. I opted for the supermarket but didn't see it marked on the GPS track as stated on the route sheet. The route turned away from Tring at one stage after the pub and tea rooms and I stopped briefly on a motorway bridge to consider. Should I take a detour, go into Tring and investigate or should I continue on the limited food supplies that I had and risk getting low on energy? I opted for the latter as I was keen to finish on time and make it to the class. On examining the map after my ride I realised I was only a hundred metres from Tring and my detour had I taken it would have been very minor and I could have stocked up with food without using up too much valuable time.</p>
<p>I hadn't reckoned on any climbs but at the very end there were one or two and the cramping in my right leg didn't help. I tried to use as little effort as I could. No point in killing myself on the climb for only a marginal speed gain. I wanted to make the final stage what was left of the actual Audax but the ride from there (Hillingdon) to the client's house. I wanted to stop sooner but I was feeling on fairly good form so I thought the best strategy would be to hold off as long as I could and stop perhaps 20km from the finish and then continue all the way to my class. After the final climbs in Chorleywood and Denham I finished at 19:00. That was 10 and a half hours which is a massive improvement on my usual 12. Time to get on the Uxbridge Road and head East. Smooth roads now, but lots of traffic lights. My energy picked up and I arrived at 20:15.</p>
<p>Yoga is something I would have done myself after the ride so why not kill two birds with one stone. But I could notice the lack of food draining my energy as the class went on. It was close to 23:00 by the time I left with added conversation after the class. I was half asleep but fairly zippy on that final ride home. I considered a kebab on the final stretch but didn't want to leave my nice bike parked. I ate some long awaited food and then went straight to bed.</p>
