<p>The end of one month seems to have blurred into the beginning of the next. On the one hand I'm busy but on the other hand I'm trying not to be busy. It's the 7th already as I start this months report which also heralds the 2nd half of the year and also 5 years since I moved into this flat in Sydenham. But when you think about it, these are all arbitrary markers of time. Days are still made up of mornings, afternoons and evenings and that fact will never change.</p>
<p>It's the 19th of July and a Sunday when I should have been on a ride which I DNS'd according to the Audax terminology (Did Not Start). I've realised that I haven't been keeping this log of my goals up to date this month so I'll try and cover the past couple of weeks. The main thing has been entertainment this month: playing Xbox, watching movies and tv shows as well as generally lounging. It's much of a carry over from the previous month and the longer run of days at home due to having quit my Tuesday yoga class which means that effectively I'm only working one day a week. Part of the plan with that was to use the day to work on my programming both in terms of finding some part-time work and studying to learn new things as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>As I mentioned last month I wanted to move away from the higher rep ranges as this is really about strength rather than fitness and I also want to work on size as well as strength. So I'm still doing pull ups with the wheel truing stands in a backpack and have made all of the exercises more difficult in order to increase the difficulty and keep the rep range low which helps to develop strength especially now that I am able to do proper pull-ups which I wasn't able when I first began this routine. But it has made the session very intense and as such I have changed it from a thrice weekly activity to a twice weekly one now that Tuesdays are free. Tuesday and Fridays.</p>
<p>On the 22nd I met up with my friend Greg whom I haven't seen in a while and rather than meet at his home we met at Barrack Field in Woolwich. There were rows of pull-up bars there and parallel bars too. Although he hasn't been doing it recently he was regularly practising calisthenics both by himself and in a group. It's street exercise done in parks and involves moves and positions similar gymnastic rings. I did some pull-ups and dips and attempted an exercise called the "muscle up" which is a pull-up followed immediately by a push-up on the bar so that your shoulders are above the bar when you finish and your arms are straight. The change from pull-up to push-up was the hardest part and even with some help from Greg pushing up my legs I still found it very demanding and didn't manage. He suggested I work on my wide arm dip which I did and which I have now incorporated into my regular routine.</p>

<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p>Still doing the 5:2 of course as it's for life. Actually, my plan was to keep it up for at least 2 years as that was how long I managed to maintain the Zone diet and then to see how it goes from then on. I'm not exactly sure when I started but I think it's about year now. A couple of months ago I was keeping track of my veg intake and in that month I think I did increase the amount of veg I was eating due to keeping a log but now I seem to have gone back to eating chocolate and crisps which isn't great in terms of health. All the bad stuff: sugar, fat and salt. I haven't been cooking much and eating more take aways that I used to which has also caused the drop in veg intake. What can I do about it? Don't know really. I think the first step is to try and build motivation. It is nice to be able to eat whatever the hell I like but I am slowly poisoning myself so rather than trying to get myself to stop eating crap, I think the solution should be more a case of persuading myself to eat more of the good stuff too. My body gets depleted from the amount of exercise that I do so I think it's important to feed it well.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>I have missed a handful of sessions but that's all. Currently my general policy is to go freeform and practice intuitively. That is working well and getting me on the on the mat but I am noticing in the few classes that I teach that I am dropping in terms of my flexibility and stamina because yoga has become less of a thing in my life. I'm still happy that I'm maintaining a regular practice but it does need stepping up but then I don't want to force it and find that I lose what I have: yoga should be organic and as such if there is any stepping up then it will come when the time is right.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p>I've definitely lost touch with it this month. So many things that I'm not really sure about keeping or discarding and I haven't been following my rule about the small items. My rule about the small items was that it didn't matter if the item in question was small or seemed too small an item for clutter clearance but gone is gone. Out of sight isn't necessarily out of mind because I know that I still have it.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>Rode my first unofficial 400km along with two fellow Audax riders. It was the Dunwich Dynamo ride which I've been wanting to ride for a while. We rode there and back. I've written more fully about in a dedicated post rather than make this one too cluttered.</p>
<p>On Tuesday the 14th I rode with Luke into Kent following an Audax ride that he had ridden. He likes quite hilly rides. I prefer flatter ones myself but am growing to enjoy hilly ones as I'm finding that being lighter I can climb far more easily than I used to. It's the long descents that I find challenging, especially the steep, dark and gravelly ones which are numerous on those roads. It was a lovely day for a ride but I must own that I did find the constant climbing and descending a bit too trying. We did stop for a couple of good breaks. Once in Langton Green at a tiny sandwich shop which had a couple of tables outside and then at Uckfield where we had a bit of tea and cake. Luke is quite partial to a coffee and even though I like a cup of tea myself I don't feel that I've missed out if I haven't stopped to have one during a ride. In fact my preferred option is to get the food down and then crack on with the ride. It was quite freeing to be able to take our time and not have to watch the clock or collect receipts. Occasionally I did want to push the pace and at other times I found that it was just right but that is how it goes when you ride with others: sometimes it's too fast and sometimes it's too slow. Riding on a geared bike though it made it easier to move at a similar speed which I find more difficult on fixed. The route passed through Edenbridge which was where I rode my first ever Audax and it was the first time I had been back since 2012. We climbed the hill that was toward the end of the ride called Toys Hill. It was tough but nothing like how I had remembered it in my mind. There is definitely a sense of accomplishment when one reaches the top of a climb and now that I'm finding the climbs so much easier than I used to especially on gears I should perhaps try some more hilly rides to get myself used to them. Who knows, perhaps I might even start to like them.</p>
<p>Today, the 19th, I was due to ride a calendar 200 but decided to DNS. I had booked it weeks ago but it would have meant an overnight stay in Brighton, which initially I was looking forward to but as it came closer to the date I found that I just wanted to stay at home. I hadn't created a GPS route from the route sheet and there was some heavy rain expected at some point during the day. I still need to ride a 200 to fulfil my RRtY requirement for this month and to this end I have booked on a DIY Perm event called the Boat Trip which I'll ride tomorrow. The .gpx file was available for download and I don't need to take a train to get to the start.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p>As I've already mentioned, the plan was to quit teaching on Tuesdays, use the time to first enjoy a good amount of leisure activities and then start looking for part-time programming work and generally clocking up programming hours. But what should I do during those hours?  I came across a course which was more of a lecture series discussing just that. Whatever I chose to study, the main cost would be time and therefore how best should I invest that time? There certainly isn't enough time to learn lots of different technologies so I need to focus on one stack comprising of platforms, tools, programming languages. It needs to be both something that I would want to learn as a hobby or past-time but also with job prospects.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>This one is on hold again while I continue with the roller training sessions.</p>
<p>I got an email from Type Scout informing me that my annual subscription was about expire and as it was only 15.00 USD I decided to renew it as I think I will start using it again and they also have a new feature called Daily News which I tried out.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>I seemed to be finding renewed vigour again last month but towards the end of the month and into the beginning of this month it has all but dwindled away. I was enjoying the book, Don Quixote, but seem to be using my spare time gaming and watching "Lost Girl" when I do have the opportunity to read. It's not a difficult book at all but perhaps I need to choose something even more low brow such as one of the Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child so that at least I'm in the swing of reading again.</p>
<p>I finished the Jack Reacher book that I downloaded called "The Affair". I found it a very easy read with perhaps only a handful of words to look up throughout the whole book as opposed to that many every chapter in the classic novels to which I've grown accustomed. There is part of me that is a book snob and thinks this sort of book is too low brow for me to waste my time but if you see how I spend my screen time watching blockbuster movies and tv shows then compared to that reading anything at all is a step up. I did clock up many reading hours and I did enjoy it very much.</p>
<p>Having finished "The Affair" I followed it up immediately with another Lee Child book called "61 Hours". The next one from the Jack Reacher series. One of the reasons I have been reading classics is not particularly to be high brow but because the classic books are free. These ones do cost money but I think it's better that I pay and read rather than get a book for free but don't read it.</p>
