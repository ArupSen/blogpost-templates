<p>As we launch into the month of October I feel that I am looking back over the year already and thinking that I've done rather well this year and that I'm moving from strength to strength. I'm very impressed and happy with what I've achieved and starting to wonder about goals for the forthcoming year even though there are still three whole months left of this one. In the past I remember that around the time of my birthday I sort of review my life and I guess that is starting to happen now.</p>
<p>One other thing that has carried over after writing the report from September 2015 is that because all of these goals are ongoing there isn't a specific end point apart from the Audax goal that I have set for this year which has 3 months left to run. If the other goals had clearer and more defined end points then it would be easier to create monthly sub-goals in order to move towards them more easily. What I've been doing with these reports is simply to account for what has been happening and hopefully to about it as soon as it happens to keep things as fresh as possible but haven't thought of it as a tool for formulating goals. It does sort of happen by accident but last month after crunching the numbers for a healthier eating plan and coming up with one portion of fruit and veg per meal, I thought I could do a similar thing to my other goals. Sometimes even though a clear end point isn't apparent, if I had to sit down and describe it to someone then a better idea would emerge and it is something that I need to do with each of the goals listed below. It's now the 4th of October so I will set forth as best I can clear ideas of where I am trying to get to with each of these goals.</p>
