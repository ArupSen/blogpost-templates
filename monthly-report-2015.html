<p>Remember, remember the 5th of November. Well, that's today and I feel stoked that I have already ticked off my November Audax ride which I rode on Sunday 1st. I do feel a little behind in some things though and as I haven't yet finished my report for October I feel that I may end up writing things that I wanted to say in that report rather than look ahead to the month ahead. One of the new things that I launched in last months report was that as well as tracking goals I was going to use the report at least at the start of the month to set goals just for that particular month.</p>
<p>I spent most of the week after my big ride of the month lazing about and recovering. Not that I didn't do any work but allowed myself to put my feet up. On Saturday the 7th I watched a lot of TV (I call it TV even though it's not live TV but in that it involves sitting and watching a screen) and didn't feel too disappointed with myself. There was a small amount but not the usual level of guilt and despair that I've failed my life as it were. I saw that whatever activities we engage in during this very short life of ours should be fun and engaging rather than forced or regimented: after all, these are the principles upon which I base my goals; they should be fueled by passion and by fun.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>I have been progressing really well and I have been increasing all of my reps with the routine that I started in the summer. I have been setting some goals for next year but I have been getting distracted by size and appearance rather than fitness and strength. The workout started life as a supplement to bike training and has grown into a project in itself and I seem to have embraced the bar calisthenics / street workout philosophy of training. The goals for next year are to be able to perform a 'muscle-up' movement as well as a free standing handstand and a movement called a lever. The thing about increasing reps is that it makes the session a lot longer so what I need to do is to change the exercises to make them harder ones and also ones that will lead towards the goals for next year: no reason why I shouldn't start working on them already; the year marker is an arbitrary one after all.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p>The goal for October was to add extra protein to the diet and eat a little more veg. I failed on the veg front but did make it a new habit to change my breakfast from toast to porridge and eggs, at least on the days that I don't fast. That's five days a week, which is a significant change. On the fasting days of course for the evening meal I do eat veg so that's already two days out of seven taken care of so for this month I'm going to aim low: rather than shoot for 3 portions a day I'm going to aim for one a day. I know that I could aim for two a day as there isn't really much of an opportunity for breakfast but I think that the way I seem to work is to take things a step at a time and establish myself at that level before taking another step. I've noticed this is my way of progress from the cycling. Others can take a leap forward, fall and try again at that bigger step but I prefer not to fall but to make sure that I can make that step rather than a big jump. It takes me a long time to recover if I fall so I try to avoid it.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>What I'd like to do this month is to create a sequence and then follow it. I sort of have a sequence in that I tend to work on certain postures but it needs to be more definitive a bit like my strength training routine. I'm a bit more lax with yoga so if I happen to change things a little that's OK but it would be good to have a clearer idea of a routine at least for this month.</p>
<p>What's happened with my yoga is that it has become a way of logging something else other than entertainment when I want to watch TV. I essentially do a few stretches while watching TV (YouTube or other streaming services) which is very distracting and doesn't allow me to focus fully on the practice. That's how it has been so far this month and I do postures that allow me to stay facing the screen. It's a struggle between maintenance and progress. There is enough of an urge to maintain my practice and by the same token I continue to teach a few classes but I don't really have the drive to take it any further. I do have the occasional burst lasting a day or two but that's all.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p>As I'm still a bit disappointed with my performance on this one and often lose track with what I have that needs to be discarded or is perhaps a candidate my plan is to create a database especially as I have been studying them recently.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>I have already ridden my 200km ride for this month and it has been validated which means that my goal of RRtY is almost complete and there is no pressure on me to ride again this month. But as with the strength training I already have goals for next year which is to ride a 400 and a 600 km distance. I need to maintain my fitness and take it up a notch.</p>
<p>One thing the RRtY has taught me is how to ride when I don't want to ride due to having a goal for the year. I was wondering if I should aim for something like this for my other goals. I'm also affiliated to a group and the challenge is something that I can share with that group. I think I need something like this for my programming as it's very much stop and start.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p>I think the plan is to run with the enthusiasm that I have for databases until it dries up and go back to Javascript.</p>
<p>There is still a little bit of career development or enhancement tied up with my programming studies and I think that is where the pressure comes from when I have time to work on it but don't. As I've mentioned in the rides section above I have benefited a great deal from being part of a group with my Audax rides even though the association is very loose. Perhaps the goal for this month could be to find a group of some sort; something that would help me to stay focused.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>For next year the plan is to work on my typing 2-3 times a week rather than aiming for a daily routine and then having perhaps an intensive month at some point.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>Due to my poor performance last month and also due to the lack of passion for it I was wondering to drop this goal but while looking for an easy book this month to get me started again I thought I'd try the Scarlet Letter once again, so that's my book for November. Who knows, I may actually get to the end.</p>
