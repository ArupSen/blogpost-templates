<p>Having plugged in my bluetooth earphones and connected to <a href="http://bassdrive.com" title="bassdrive" target="_blank">bassdrive.com</a> I mounted the bike on the rollers and threw my leg over it. Wearing only cycling shorts and shoes as it was a very hot day in London I got into my cadence very quickly and even grooved to the beat. No fear of falling and very comfortable. Spent most of the time wondering about my speed and cadence. I did notice that my front wheel did remain between the markers on the front rollers but my rear was not so steady in terms of position. This was due to my pedal stroke and I wondered how I could improve upon it. At one point I did lose concentration and almost tipped over. My elbow hit one wall and I saved myself with the other hand. Shows that my confidence is greatly improving and that my anxiety has almost gone. By the end I was dripping with sweat and really felt that I had done a workout.</p>
