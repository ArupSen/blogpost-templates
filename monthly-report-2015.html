<p>Remember, remember the 5th of November. Well, that's today and I feel stoked that I have already ticked off my November Audax ride which I rode on Sunday 1st. I do feel a little behind in some things though and as I haven't yet finished my report for October I feel that I may end up writing things that I wanted to say in that report rather than look ahead to the month ahead. One of the new things that I launched in last months report was that as well as tracking goals I was going to use the report at least at the start of the month to set goals just for that particular month.</p>
<p>I spent most of the week after my big ride of the month lazing about and recovering. Not that I didn't do any work but allowed myself to put my feet up. On Saturday the 7th I watched a lot of TV (I call it TV even though it's not live TV but in that it involves sitting and watching a screen) and didn't feel too disappointed with myself. There was a small amount but not the usual level of guilt and despair that I've failed my life as it were. I saw that whatever activities we engage in during this very short life of ours should be fun and engaging rather than forced or regimented: after all, these are the principles upon which I base my goals; they should be fueled by passion and by fun.</p>
<p>It's now the 15th and halfway through the month and it feels a little bit like last month in that it feels like the month is running away without a real chance to set specific goals for the month and then keep up with the reporting. One thing I should mention is that there has been an increase in entertainment. I've added a new section under that heading just to go into detail about it as it seems to be becoming a feature.</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Strength Training</h4>
<p>I have been progressing really well and I have been increasing all of my reps with the routine that I started in the summer. I have been setting some goals for next year but I have been getting distracted by size and appearance rather than fitness and strength. The workout started life as a supplement to bike training and has grown into a project in itself and I seem to have embraced the bar calisthenics / street workout philosophy of training. The goals for next year are to be able to perform a 'muscle-up' movement as well as a free standing handstand and a movement called a lever. The thing about increasing reps is that it makes the session a lot longer so what I need to do is to change the exercises to make them harder ones and also ones that will lead towards the goals for next year: no reason why I shouldn't start working on them already; the year marker is an arbitrary one after all.</p>
<p>Earlier this week on Wednesday 11th November I received a set of wooden gymnastic rings. After considering a few ideas of either adding a garden pull up bar or a pull up bar in the hallway, I still needed a way of doing dips. For a few workouts I started to do them in between my kitchen counters but found them a bit too wide and this was worrying in terms of injury prevention. A couple of friends recommended gymnastic rings and did a few searches on Google and YouTube to get a better idea on well they would serve me. The reviews looked very positive and loved the idea of them being flexible and allowing many different exercises to be performed as well as staying true to the bodyweight exercise format. In addition to be able to perform all of the exercises in my current routine I would be able to purchase them cheaply (these were just over 20 GBP including delivery) and also work on my core strength which was one of the main reasons that I started on this path. Having opened the box I set up the rings very easily and swapped out some of the exercises from my current routine for versions with rings. I found my first experience of them to be highly enjoyable but very challenging at the same time. All the ring versions of the exercises were a lot more difficult but at the same time very rewarding. On Friday 13th November I used them again but swapped out even more of the exercises and pushed myself even harder. I was surprised at how quickly my stability had increased. It's possible to hang the rings from any stable overhead supporting structure. I used my pull up bar but I was considering using the branch of a tree when the weather gets warmer again and I am feeling brave.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Healthier diet</h4>
<p>The goal for October was to add extra protein to the diet and eat a little more veg. I failed on the veg front but did make it a new habit to change my breakfast from toast to porridge and eggs, at least on the days that I don't fast. That's five days a week, which is a significant change. On the fasting days of course for the evening meal I do eat veg so that's already two days out of seven taken care of so for this month I'm going to aim low: rather than shoot for 3 portions a day I'm going to aim for one a day. I know that I could aim for two a day as there isn't really much of an opportunity for breakfast but I think that the way I seem to work is to take things a step at a time and establish myself at that level before taking another step. I've noticed this is my way of progress from the cycling. Others can take a leap forward, fall and try again at that bigger step but I prefer not to fall but to make sure that I can make that step rather than a big jump. It takes me a long time to recover if I fall so I try to avoid it.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Daily yoga practice</h4>
<p>What I'd like to do this month is to create a sequence and then follow it. I sort of have a sequence in that I tend to work on certain postures but it needs to be more definitive a bit like my strength training routine. I'm a bit more lax with yoga so if I happen to change things a little that's OK but it would be good to have a clearer idea of a routine at least for this month.</p>
<p>What's happened with my yoga is that it has become a way of logging something else other than entertainment when I want to watch TV. I essentially do a few stretches while watching TV (YouTube or other streaming services) which is very distracting and doesn't allow me to focus fully on the practice. That's how it has been so far this month and I do postures that allow me to stay facing the screen. It's a struggle between maintenance and progress. There is enough of an urge to maintain my practice and by the same token I continue to teach a few classes but I don't really have the drive to take it any further. I do have the occasional burst lasting a day or two but that's all.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Clearing clutter</h4>
<p>As I'm still a bit disappointed with my performance on this one and often lose track with what I have that needs to be discarded or is perhaps a candidate my plan is to create a database especially as I have been studying them recently.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Audax and rides</h4>
<p>I have already ridden my 200km ride for this month and it has been validated which means that my goal of RRtY is almost complete and there is no pressure on me to ride again this month. But as with the strength training I already have goals for next year which is to ride a 400 and a 600 km distance. I need to maintain my fitness and take it up a notch.</p>
<p>One thing the RRtY has taught me is how to ride when I don't want to ride due to having a goal for the year. I was wondering if I should aim for something like this for my other goals. I'm also affiliated to a group and the challenge is something that I can share with that group. I think I need something like this for my programming as it's very much stop and start.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Programming courses</h4>
<p>I think the plan is to run with the enthusiasm that I have for databases until it dries up and go back to Javascript.</p>
<p>There is still a little bit of career development or enhancement tied up with my programming studies and I think that is where the pressure comes from when I have time to work on it but don't. As I've mentioned in the rides section above I have benefited a great deal from being part of a group with my Audax rides even though the association is very loose. Perhaps the goal for this month could be to find a group of some sort; something that would help me to stay focused.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Typing</h4>
<p>For next year the plan is to work on my typing 2-3 times a week rather than aiming for a daily routine and then having perhaps an intensive month at some point.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Reading</h4>
<p>Due to my poor performance last month and also due to the lack of passion for it I was wondering to drop this goal but while looking for an easy book this month to get me started again I thought I'd try the Scarlet Letter once again, so that's my book for November. Who knows, I may actually get to the end.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Entertainment</h4>
<p>The couch potato is making a comeback. It's been happening through the year but I am no longer in denial about it. I've been bingeing on TV series and there are days when I watch up to 4 episodes of a series which is around 3 hours in total. I'm allowing myself to do this and feeling less guilty and anxious about it and even seem to be applauding and facilitating it this month by looking into my overall entertainment strategy.</p>
<p>At the start of the year I got myself a Cineworld Unlimited card in order to try and offset the time I spend watching movies and TV series at home by making an event out of it. This did actually work for a very short time but soon I found that the films on offer didn't excite me or they weren't available at a time that suited me. I also found that movies I really did want to watch were not on release for long enough and if I missed the window they were simply gone. As the year has gone on I haven't been going to the cinema more than 3 times a month which is what is required to make the purchase of the Unlimited card worthwhile. It's been great to have it in order to go and have a father and daughter date with Maya but that formula can become a little repetitive after a while and the money I saved on my own ticket got used up in paying for snacks and drinks as well as her ticket. If in that month I hadn't gone to the cinema on my own i.e. at any other time then I was effectively paying more than the normal adult price for a ticket than assuming that I had got free entry. Owing to the above I am wondering if I should continue and renew my Unlimited card in 2016. There are some movies that do benefit from the big screen experience and 3D can be very enjoyable too but neither of these are enough of a draw for me to continue to pay my &pound;18.99 a month. Given my current lifestyle and my taste in movies this arrangement clearly isn't working.</p>
<p>Enter online streaming. Having made use of the various 'free' online streaming services and the less than SD quality that is on offer, I have been exploring my options in the world of paid subscriber streaming services. There are many to choose from but at the top of the list are Netflix and Amazon Instant Video. I've signed up for months free trial with Netflix and have been busy consuming content. The first assumption to be burst was that it was a repository of content but that is not the case: they operate more like a channel. Not everything you could imagine is on offer or even available indefinitely. Rather like BBC iPlayer, programmes are available until a certain date. What I like so far is that there is a good choice and plenty that I like. The picture quality is very good and far better than what I've been used to from the 'free' streaming services. I like the user interface. There is a good selection for kids which means that Maya can be entertained when she is visiting. But I am slightly miffed that it is not a library of films and TV as I had hoped which would be available indefinitely. There were certain series that I was following before I signed up that were not available on Netflix. So it means that what I will be paying for is the user interface and the picture quality. I imagine that in due course the 'free' channels will eventually offer HD and in the meantime, if I do choose to sign up properly to Netflix and find that a series I really want to watch is not available then I can still watch it on the 'free' service. I was hoping also to discard movies that I have archived on DVD etc. but if Netflix has an expiry date on content then perhaps I should hold on to it.</p>
<p>But to return to the idea of entertainment itself: I seem to be less guilty about it as part of my life and allowing it to exist or co-exist. It's not a goal as such but then perhaps it is in an implicit way. I do choose certain movies and TV series to watch and then spend time watching them. I get excited about watching them and I tend to focus and drop everything else while I do it. The guilt isn't totally gone, far from it but at least I seem to be managing it better and not pretending that this something that I want to banish from my life. I'm not proud of the fact that I spend a lot of time watching TV, especially binge watching, but there it is. Better than drink or drugs I guess. As well as the guilt there is a measure of disappointment too but I'm trying to justify and rationalise my saying that perhaps all pursuits are a form of entertainment.</p>
